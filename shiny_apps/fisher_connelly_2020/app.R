            <h3>Fisher & Connelly (2020): Building the Business Case for Hiring People with Disabilities</h3>
            <p><strong>Research Question:</strong> What is the financial business case for employing workers with disabilities?</p>
            
            <h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Service Value:</strong> Economic value generated by employee performance</li>
              <li><strong>Service Costs:</strong> Wages, benefits, behavioral costs, turnover, and accommodations</li>
              <li><strong>Accommodation Costs:</strong> One-time and ongoing costs to support workers with disabilities</li>
              <li><strong>Performance Adjustment:</strong> Actual vs. expected performance based on empirical data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Study Context:</h4>
            <p>This analysis uses data from a Canadian social enterprise employing both workers with and without disabilities 
            in manufacturing roles. The study tracked actual costs and performance over time to build an evidence-based business case.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Innovation:</h4>
            <p>Unlike typical diversity analyses that focus only on costs, this study measures both costs AND benefits, 
            including actual performance data and comprehensive cost tracking.</p>

            <p style='text-align: justify; margin: 15px 0;'>
            This paper demonstrates a technique to empirically estimate the financial costs (or savings) of employing people with disabilities, in order to provide a mechanism for organizations to develop a 'business case' for hiring these employees. We conducted a utility analysis, a technique common in Human Resources Management (HRM), to illustrate how the financial net value can be calculated based on the difference between service costs and service value. Employment costs include those related to wages, health benefits, pensions, life insurance, vacation pay, training, safety, absences, lateness, turnover, and disability accommodations. Service value estimates are based on wages and are adjusted for performance levels. The data used for our example is drawn from a food services company in Canada. Employees with disabilities in this example provided higher net value to the organization because of their average to above-average performance and lower turnover costs. More importantly, we demonstrate a process that can be used to assess the financial value of hiring workers with disabilities. Given the negative preconceptions often associated with hiring workers with disabilities, this method and example can provide evidence that will be useful for managers and disability advocates for assisting people who wish to join the workforce.

# Executive Summary

This report analyzes the business case for employing workers with disabilities based on the comprehensive methodology from Fisher & Connelly (2020). The analysis demonstrates that inclusive hiring practices create substantial financial value beyond just social responsibility.

## Key Findings from Your Scenario

```{r key_findings}
# Calculate key metrics in this chunk
disabled_net <- scenario_data$net_value[1]
nondisabled_net <- scenario_data$net_value[2]
advantage <- disabled_net - nondisabled_net
total_advantage <- advantage * num_disabled

# Check for valid calculations
if(length(disabled_net) > 0 && !is.na(disabled_net) && !is.na(nondisabled_net)) {
  cat("‚Ä¢ **Net Value per Employee with Disabilities:** $", format(round(disabled_net), big.mark = ","), " annually\\n")
  cat("‚Ä¢ **Net Value per Employee without Disabilities:** $", format(round(nondisabled_net), big.mark = ","), " annually\\n")
  cat("‚Ä¢ **Annual Advantage per Employee:** $", format(round(advantage), big.mark = ","), "\\n")
  cat("‚Ä¢ **Total Annual Advantage for ", num_disabled, " employees:** $", format(round(total_advantage), big.mark = ","), "\\n")
  
  # Calculate ROI using the annual accommodation cost
  if(accommodation_annual > 0 && advantage > 0) {
    roi_percent <- round((advantage / accommodation_annual) * 100, 0)
    cat("‚Ä¢ **ROI on Accommodation Costs:** ", roi_percent, "%\\n")
  } else if(accommodation_annual == 0) {
    cat("‚Ä¢ **ROI on Accommodation Costs:** Infinite (no annual accommodation costs)\\n")
  } else {
    cat("‚Ä¢ **ROI on Accommodation Costs:** N/A\\n")
  }
} else {
  cat("‚Ä¢ **Error in calculations - please check input parameters**\\n")
}

# Make variables available for other chunks
advantage <<- advantage
disabled_net <<- disabled_net
nondisabled_net <<- nondisabled_net
total_advantage <<- total_advantage
```

The analysis shows that employing workers with disabilities provides **significant financial advantages** when all costs and benefits are properly accounted for.

# Conclusion

```{r conclusion_metrics}
# Calculate final metrics for conclusion
if(!exists("advantage") || is.null(advantage)) {
  disabled_net_final <- scenario_data$net_value[1]
  nondisabled_net_final <- scenario_data$net_value[2]
  advantage_final <- disabled_net_final - nondisabled_net_final
  total_advantage_final <- advantage_final * num_disabled
} else {
  advantage_final <- advantage
  total_advantage_final <- total_advantage
}

cat("The financial case for employing workers with disabilities is compelling and evidence-based. Your analysis projects:\\n\\n")
cat("- **$", format(round(advantage_final), big.mark = ","), " annual advantage per employee**\\n")
cat("- **$", format(round(total_advantage_final), big.mark = ","), " total annual value for ", num_disabled, " employees**\\n\\n")
```

Beyond the financial benefits, inclusive hiring practices enhance organizational culture, improve customer relationships, and create sustainable competitive advantages.

The data demonstrates that employing workers with disabilities is not just a social responsibility‚Äîit\'s a financially advantageous business strategy.
