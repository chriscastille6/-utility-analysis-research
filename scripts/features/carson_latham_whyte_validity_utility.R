Imagine that you are a vice president of a large American based multi-national corporation. The company has over 10,000 employees, and last year's sales exceeded $4 billion dollars. The company is highly regarded for the quality of its products. Lately, however, some people within the organization have raised concerns about the quality of the clerical/administrative personnel that the firm has been hiring.

Potential new hires are interviewed before a decision is made to extend an offer, but at present no systematic procedures exist by which clerical/administrative employees are selected. Although you are skeptical that the methods by which your firm selects such personnel can be improved upon, an organizational consultant has been retained to investigate the issue.

This consultant specializes in the development and validation of selection practices that attempt to enable companies to select high performers in a legally defensible manner. She is also a member of the American Psychological Association, and graduated ten years ago with a Ph.D. from a prestigious university.

This particular consultant was contacted because she has done research showing that employee performance can be predicted through the use of selection testing. After a discussion of the issues, the consultant has recommended that the following steps be taken:

1. Develop a test to measure employee performance that is tailor-made to your firm;
2. Administer this test across all relevant categories of clerical/administrative personnel;
3. Correlate the results of the test with performance on the job to see how well the test predicts performance;
4. Use the results of this test to alter existing selection practices so as to improve employee performance in the clerical/administrative category.

The consultant has stated that the cost of designing and validating the selection test will be $6,100. Because you expect to hire about 470 new clerical/administrative employees this year from a large pool of applicants it is estimated that the total implementation cost of the selection program will be $423,000. This amount reflects recruiting costs, test administrators' salary, computer test scoring, and outlays for test booklets. Total costs of the consultant's recommendations, if followed, are therefore approximately $429,100.

The consultant estimates that the approximate financial gain achievable if her advice is followed is $60,208,786. This amount represents her estimate of the dollar gain from the use of new selection procedures for one year, as compared to continuing to use existing methods.

The algebraically derived model the consultant used to calculate this amount is relied on by many industrial psychologists today and was developed and refined by researchers over many years. The model is as follows:

DUR = (t)(Ns)(SDy)(rxy)(1)(f) - (Ns)(Cis) - (Ns)(Cos)

where UR is the dollar gain from the use of the selection test for one year as compared to selecting people using existing procedures; t is the average length of time the selectees stay with the organization; Ns is the number of people to be selected this year, SDy is the standard deviation of job performance in dollars; rxy is the correlation between test scores and job performance as determined by previous research; 1 is the height of the normal curve at the cutting point on the predictor (a statistic which is obtained from the f or selection ratio); f is the selection ratio (the proportion of people selected as compared to the number of people who applied for the job); Cis is the implementation cost of the selection program per person selected; and Cos is the original cost of designing and validating the selection instrument per person selected.

To compute the dollar gain, input estimates for the terms in the model were obtained from research studies and your firm's personnel records, and then entered into the above equation. The input estimates were as follows:

1. The average length of time new hires in the clerical/administrative category stay with the firm, or t is 18 years;
2. The number to be selected this year (Ns) is 470;
3. SDy Refers to the standard deviation of job performance in dollars. The larger the difference in how well people perform on the job as measured by SDy, the higher the potential gain from using selection practices that will distinguish between poor and good performers. While most of the input estimates for the model were obtained from the firm records, SDy cannot be obtained in this way but must be estimated. The SDy term is difficult to estimate, but it must be estimated in order to express in dollars the potential gain to be achieved from following the recommendations. SDy was calculated using supervisors of clerical/administrative personnel. In estimating SDy the instructions to the supervisors were as follows:

The dollar utility estimates we are asking you to make are critical in estimating the relative dollar value to the firm of different selection methods. In answering these questions, you will have to make some very difficult judgments. We realize they are difficult and that they are judgments or estimates. You will have to ponder for some time before giving each estimate, and there is probably no way you can be absolutely certain your estimate is accurate when you do reach a decision. But keep in mind three things:

1. The alternative to estimates of this kind are cost accounting procedures to the evaluation of job performance. Such applications are usually prohibitively expensive. And, in the end, they produce only imperfect estimates, like this estimation procedure.
2. Your estimates will be averaged in with those of other supervisors of clerical/administrative employees. Thus errors produced by too high and too low estimates will tend to be averaged out, providing more accurate final estimates.
3. The decisions that must be made about selection methods do not require that all estimates be accurate down to the last dollar. Substantially accurate estimates will lead to the same decisions as perfectly accurate estimates.

Based on your experience with clerical/administrative employees, we would like to estimate the yearly value to the firm of the products and services provided by the average clerical/administrative employee. Consider the quality and quantity of output typical of the average employee and the value of this output, it may help to consider what the cost would be of having an outside firm provide these products and services.

Based on my experience, I estimate the value to the firm of the average clerical/administrative employee at _____ dollars per year.

We would now like for you to consider the \"superior\" clerical/administrative employee. Let us define a superior performer as some one who is at the 85th percentile. That is, his or her performance is better than 85% of his or her fellow employees, and only 15% turn in better performances. Consider the quality and quantity of the output typical of the superior employee. Then estimate the value of these products and services. In placing an overall dollar amount on this output, it may again help to consider what the cost would be of having an outside firm provide these products and services.

Based on my experience, I estimate the value to the firm of the superior clerical/administrative employee at _____ dollars per year.

Finally, we would like you to consider the \"low-performing\" clerical/administrative employee. Let us define a low-performing employee as one who is at the 15th percentile. That is, 85% of all clerical/administrative employees turn in performances better than the low-performing employee, and only 15% turn in worse performances. Consider the quality and quantity of the output typical of the low-performing employee. Then estimate the value of these products and services. In placing an overall dollar amount on this output, it may again help to consider what the cost would be of having an outside firm provide these products and services.

Based on my experience, I estimate the value to the firm of the low-performing clerical/administrative employee at _____ dollars per year.

SDy was calculated as the average of the estimated differences between the superior and average performers and between the average and low performers. The resulting SDy estimate was $14,234. The remaining input estimates were as follows:

4. The correlation between test scores and job performance (rxy) was estimated to be .40 based on previous research;
5. The height of the normal curve at the cutting point (1) was calculated to be .3989 based on the selection ratio;
6. The selection ratio (f) was estimated to be .50 based on the number of applicants and the number of positions to be filled;
7. The implementation cost per person selected (Cis) was estimated to be $900 based on the total implementation cost of $423,000 divided by the number of people to be selected (470);
8. The original cost of designing and validating the selection instrument per person selected (Cos) was estimated to be $13 based on the total cost of $6,100 divided by the number of people to be selected (470).

Substituting these values into the utility equation yields:

UR = (18)(470)($14,234)(.40)(.3989)(.50) - (470)($900) - (470)($13)
UR = $60,208,786

As vice president of the company, it is up to you to decide whether to implement the consultant's recommendations.
