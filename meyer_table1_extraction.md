## Notes for Educational Use

1. **Sample Size Variations**: Many correlations use meta-analytic data (indicated by K = number of studies) rather than direct sample sizes.

2. **Effect Size Context**: Even "large" correlations (r = .60) only explain 36% of variance, helping students understand realistic expectations.

3. **Real-World Relevance**: These correlations represent actual research findings, not theoretical constructs.

4. **Methodological Diversity**: Studies vary in design quality, sample characteristics, and measurement approaches.

5. **Educational Value**: The intuitive correlations provide excellent examples for teaching correlation concepts using familiar relationships.
