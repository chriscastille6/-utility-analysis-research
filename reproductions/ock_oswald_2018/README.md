# Ock & Oswald (2018) Reproducibility Project
## "Comparing Compensatory and Multiple Hurdle Selection Models"

### Project Overview
This reproducibility study replicates Ock & Oswald's (2018) comparison of compensatory and multiple hurdle selection models in utility analysis contexts.

### Study Information
- **Authors**: Ock, J., & Oswald, F. L.
- **Year**: 2018
- **Title**: Comparing compensatory and multiple hurdle selection models
- **Journal**: Personnel Psychology
- **DOI**: [To be added]

### Research Questions
1. How do compensatory and multiple hurdle selection models compare in terms of utility?
2. What are the conditions under which each model performs better?
3. How do different parameter settings affect the relative performance of these models?

### Methodology
- **Selection Models**: Compensatory vs. Multiple Hurdle
- **Analysis Type**: Monte Carlo simulation
- **Key Parameters**: Validity coefficients, selection ratios, cutoff scores
- **Outcome Measures**: Utility, selection accuracy, diversity outcomes
