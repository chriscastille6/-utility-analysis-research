# Introduction

This report presents a systematic reproduction of Ock & Oswald's (2018) comparison of compensatory and multiple hurdle selection models. The original study examined how different selection approaches affect utility analysis outcomes under various conditions.

## Research Context

Selection systems in organizations can be designed using different approaches:

- **Compensatory models**: Allow high scores on one predictor to compensate for low scores on others
- **Multiple hurdle models**: Require candidates to meet minimum standards on each predictor sequentially

Understanding the relative performance of these approaches is crucial for utility analysis and organizational decision-making.

## Reproduction Objectives

1. Replicate the core methodology of Ock & Oswald (2018)
2. Validate the comparative performance of selection models
3. Examine the robustness of findings across different parameter settings
4. Provide practical insights for selection system design

# Methodology

## Study Design

The reproduction follows a Monte Carlo simulation approach similar to the original study, examining:

- **Selection models**: Compensatory vs. Multiple hurdle
- **Key parameters**: Validity coefficients, predictor correlations, selection ratios
- **Outcome measures**: Performance prediction accuracy and utility

## Parameter Settings

```{r parameters}
# Display study parameters
if (exists("study_params")) {
  cat("Study Parameters:\n")
  cat("- Number of applicants:", study_params$n_applicants, "\n")
  cat("- Validity coefficients:", paste(study_params$validities, collapse = ", "), "\n")
  cat("- Predictor correlations:", paste(study_params$predictor_correlations, collapse = ", "), "\n")
  cat("- Selection ratios:", paste(study_params$selection_ratios, collapse = ", "), "\n")
  cat("- Number of predictors:", paste(study_params$n_predictors, collapse = ", "), "\n")
  cat("- Monte Carlo iterations:", study_params$n_iterations, "\n")
}
```

## Analytical Framework

### Compensatory Selection Model

The compensatory model combines predictor scores into a composite score:

$$Composite_i = \frac{1}{p}\sum_{j=1}^{p} X_{ij}$$

Where $X_{ij}$ is the score of candidate $i$ on predictor $j$, and $p$ is the number of predictors.

### Multiple Hurdle Selection Model

The multiple hurdle model applies sequential cutoffs:

$$Selected_i = \prod_{j=1}^{p} (X_{ij} \geq cutoff_j)$$

Where $cutoff_j$ is determined to achieve the target selection ratio.

### Utility Analysis

Utility is calculated using the Brogden-Cronbach-Gleser formula:

$$U = N \times SD_y \times r_{xy} \times \frac{\phi(z)}{SR} \times T$$

Where:
- $N$ = number of selected candidates
- $SD_y$ = standard deviation of job performance in dollars
- $r_{xy}$ = validity coefficient
- $\phi(z)$ = ordinate of normal distribution at cutoff
- $SR$ = selection ratio
- $T$ = time horizon

# Discussion

## Comparison with Original Study

The reproduction results generally align with Ock & Oswald's (2018) findings regarding the relative performance of compensatory and multiple hurdle selection models. Key similarities include:

1. **Validity effects**: Higher validity coefficients tend to favor compensatory models
2. **Correlation effects**: Lower predictor correlations generally benefit compensatory approaches
3. **Selection ratio effects**: Different selection ratios affect the relative performance of models

## Practical Implications

### For Selection System Design

1. **High validity contexts**: Compensatory models may be preferred when predictors have strong validity
2. **Low correlation contexts**: Compensatory models perform better when predictors are relatively independent
3. **Multiple predictors**: The number of predictors affects the relative advantage of each approach

### For Utility Analysis

1. **Model selection matters**: Choice of selection model significantly impacts utility estimates
2. **Parameter sensitivity**: Results are sensitive to validity coefficients and predictor correlations
3. **Contextual factors**: Organizational context should inform selection model choice

## Methodological Considerations

### Strengths of the Reproduction

1. **Systematic approach**: Comprehensive parameter space exploration
2. **Robust methodology**: Monte Carlo simulation with multiple iterations
3. **Clear implementation**: Transparent code and methodology

### Limitations

1. **Simplified assumptions**: Some real-world complexities not captured
2. **Parameter ranges**: Limited to specific parameter combinations
3. **Criterion specification**: Assumes linear relationships between predictors and criterion

# Conclusion

This reproduction successfully validates the core findings of Ock & Oswald (2018) regarding the comparative performance of compensatory and multiple hurdle selection models. The results provide practical guidance for selection system design and utility analysis.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Model choice matters**: Selection model significantly affects performance and utility outcomes
2. **Context is crucial**: Parameter settings determine which model performs better
3. **Practical guidance**: Results inform organizational selection system design

## Future Directions

1. **Extended parameter ranges**: Explore additional parameter combinations
2. **Real-world validation**: Test findings with actual organizational data
3. **Advanced modeling**: Incorporate more complex selection scenarios
