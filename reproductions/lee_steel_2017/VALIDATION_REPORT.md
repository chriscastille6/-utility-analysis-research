## VALIDATION METHODOLOGY

### 1. Zxs Calculation Validation

**Purpose**: Verify the accuracy of Zxs (expected value of selected applicants' criterion scores) calculations using Naylor & Shine (1965) tables.

**Method**: Compare our calculated Zxs values against known values from the Naylor & Shine (1965) tables for selection ratios ranging from 1% to 50%.

**Results**: 
- **All 11 Zxs values matched exactly** with expected values
- **Zero differences** across all selection ratios
- **Perfect accuracy** for interpolation between table values

**Validation Status**: ✅ **FULLY VALIDATED**

### 2. Utility Calculation Validation

**Purpose**: Verify the accuracy of Brogden-Cronbach-Gleser utility calculations across various parameter combinations.

**Method**: Test utility calculations against manually computed expected values for six different test cases:
- Low validity (rxy = 0.10)
- High validity (rxy = 0.50)
- Low selection ratio (m = 0.05)
- High selection ratio (m = 0.50)
- Low performance SD (SDy = $5,000)
- High performance SD (SDy = $20,000)

**Results**:
- **All 6 utility calculations matched exactly** with expected values
- **Zero differences** across all test cases
- **Perfect accuracy** for all parameter combinations

**Validation Status**: ✅ **FULLY VALIDATED**

### 3. Literature Comparison

**Purpose**: Compare our results with established utility analysis literature to ensure consistency with field standards.

**Method**: Compare our reproduction results with published utility analysis studies including Schmidt & Hunter (1983), Boudreau & Berger (1985), Sturman (2000), and Seijts et al. (2020).

**Results**:
- **Our utility per employee ($41,500)** falls within expected ranges
- **Our ROI (8,300%)** is higher than typical literature values, indicating strong parameter assumptions
- **Parameter ranges** are consistent with field standards
- **Methodological approach** aligns with established utility analysis frameworks

**Validation Status**: ✅ **CONSISTENT WITH LITERATURE**

### 4. Extreme Case Sensitivity Analysis

**Purpose**: Test the robustness of the utility model under extreme parameter conditions.

**Method**: Analyze utility calculations under three extreme scenarios:
- **Very Low Validity**: rxy = 0.05, SDy = $5,000, m = 0.50, T = 1, C = $500
- **Very High Validity**: rxy = 0.80, SDy = $30,000, m = 0.01, T = 20, C = $50
- **Moderate Parameters**: rxy = 0.40, SDy = $15,000, m = 0.15, T = 8, C = $200

**Results**:
- **Very Low Validity**: Negative utility (-$80,050) as expected for poor selection conditions
- **Very High Validity**: Extremely high utility ($127,420,000) demonstrating model sensitivity
- **Moderate Parameters**: Reasonable utility ($7,325,867) within expected ranges
- **All calculations mathematically sound** and logically consistent

**Validation Status**: ✅ **ROBUST UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS**
