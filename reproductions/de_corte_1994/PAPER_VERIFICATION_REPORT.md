### ⚠️ Needs Review (3/12)

| Calculation | Original Value | Our Value | Status |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| μ_y(x_c) - Average payoff of selectees | $28,430 | Not calculated | Needs Review |
| μ_y(x_c,r_c) - Average payoff of successful selectees | $29,947 | Not calculated | Needs Review |
| μ_y(r_c) - Average payoff of random successful | $28,279 | Not calculated | Needs Review |

## Detailed Analysis

### Critical Values
Both critical values (x_c and r_c) were calculated with **excellent precision**:
- **x_c (Critical predictor score)**: 1.15 vs 1.15 (0.03% difference)
- **r_c (Critical performance score)**: -0.42 vs -0.42 (0.05% difference)

These values are fundamental to the entire utility calculation and their accuracy validates our mathematical framework.

### Utility Calculations
The core utility calculations show **outstanding agreement**:

1. **Utility with predictor (U_p)**: $983,955 vs $983,201 (-0.08% difference)
2. **Utility with random selection (U_0)**: $523,635 vs $523,635 (0.00% difference)
3. **Utility difference (ΔU)**: $460,320 vs $459,566 (-0.16% difference)

The small differences (less than 0.2%) are likely due to:
- Rounding differences in intermediate calculations
- Minor variations in numerical precision
- Slight differences in the bivariate normal probability calculations

### Success Ratios
Both success ratios match **perfectly**:
- **Selection ratio**: 0.125 vs 0.125 (0.00% difference)
- **Random success ratio**: 0.663 vs 0.663 (-0.03% difference)

### Fixed Quota Analysis
The fixed quota calculations show **excellent agreement**:
- **Fixed quota utility difference**: $344,774 vs $344,824 (0.01% difference)
- **Corrected utility difference**: $298,538 vs $298,539 (0.00% difference)

## Parameter Verification

All input parameters used in our reproduction match the original paper:

| Parameter | Original Value | Our Value | Status |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| N (Number of hires) | 17 | 17 | ✅ Match |
| n (Applicant pool size) | 136 | 136 | ✅ Match |
| μ_s (Average service cost) | $22,500 | $22,500 | ✅ Match |
| Time (Average time periods) | 11 | 11 | ✅ Match |
| S_p (Success ratio predictor) | 0.853 | 0.853 | ✅ Match |
| μ_y (Average performance payoff) | $25,000 | $25,000 | ✅ Match |
| C_t (Training cost per hire) | $10,000 | $10,000 | ✅ Match |
| C_p (Cost per candidate) | $200 | $200 | ✅ Match |
| C_s (Separation cost) | $1,000 | $1,000 | ✅ Match |
| ρ_yR (Correlation payoff-performance) | 0.85 | 0.85 | ✅ Match |
| σ_y (Performance standard deviation) | $7,000 | $7,000 | ✅ Match |
| ρ (Predictor validity) | 0.35 | 0.35 | ✅ Match |

## Areas for Improvement

### Missing Intermediate Calculations
Three intermediate calculations were not included in our reproduction:
1. μ_y(x_c) - Average payoff of selectees
2. μ_y(x_c,r_c) - Average payoff of successful selectees  
3. μ_y(r_c) - Average payoff of random successful

These values are useful for understanding the detailed mechanics but don't affect the final utility calculations.

### Recommendations
1. **Add Intermediate Calculations**: Include the three missing payoff calculations for completeness
2. **Enhance Documentation**: Add more detailed step-by-step calculations
3. **Monte Carlo Analysis**: Add uncertainty quantification as planned

## Conclusion

The De Corte (1994) reproduction is **highly successful**. All major utility calculations match the original paper within 0.2% tolerance, and critical values are reproduced with excellent precision. The small differences observed are well within acceptable limits for numerical calculations and likely due to minor rounding or precision differences.

### Verification Status: ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED**

The reproduction accurately captures the mathematical framework and economic logic of De Corte's utility analysis for selection decisions with probationary periods. The results provide strong confidence that our implementation correctly reproduces the original methodology.

### Next Steps
1. Add the missing intermediate calculations for completeness
2. Proceed with planned Monte Carlo analysis
3. Explore sensitivity analyses and modern extensions
4. Consider practical applications and case studies
