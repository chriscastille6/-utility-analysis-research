## KEY FINDINGS - VALIDATED

### Perfect Match with Reported Values
| Metric | Reported | Calculated | Difference |
|--------|----------|------------|------------|
| 15-year utility | CAD $564,128 | CAD $564,103 | **0.0%** |
| 10-year utility | CAD $375,285 | CAD $375,261 | **0.0%** |
| 15-year yearly | CAD $37,609 | CAD $37,607 | **0.0%** |
| 10-year yearly | CAD $37,529 | CAD $37,526 | **0.0%** |

### Economic Adjustments Range (Updated)
- **15-year tenure**: CAD $162,396 to CAD $5,386,787
- **10-year tenure**: CAD $88,259 to CAD $2,452,241
- **Most scenarios**: Still yield positive returns despite adjustments

### Parameter Sensitivity (Validated)
- **Most sensitive**: Incremental validity parameter
- **Least sensitive**: Variable costs rate
- **Conservative scenarios**: Align with reported values

## METHODOLOGICAL INSIGHTS - RESOLVED

### Zxs Calculation Mystery Solved
- **Issue**: Different Zxs calculation methods created 2.48x difference
- **Our method**: qnorm(1-selection_ratio) = 0.44
- **Their method**: Naylor & Shine (1965) tables = 1.09
- **Solution**: Use Naylor & Shine tables for accurate selection scenarios

### Economic Adjustments (Validated)
- **Variable Costs**: -0.02 to -0.35 (reduces utility)
- **Taxation Rate**: 0.30 to 0.63 (reduces utility)
- **Discounting**: 0.01 to 0.11 (reduces utility)
- **Incremental Validity**: 0.05 to 0.30 (increases utility)

### Conservative Estimates (Updated)
- **Lower bound**: CAD $88K to CAD $162K
- **Upper bound**: CAD $2.5M to CAD $5.4M
- **Median values**: CAD $668K to CAD $1.2M
