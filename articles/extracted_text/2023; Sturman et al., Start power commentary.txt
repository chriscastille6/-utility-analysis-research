    the use of utility analysis as strong theory, implemented
    with computational modeling. We articulate why we see the
    Joo et al. (2022) paper contributing to a strong theory about
    employee value and how its efforts represent more of a the-
    oretical contribution to the star performers, employee value,
    employee performance, and utility analysis literatures than
    one simply about the specific returns on investment related
    to acquiring star employees. Our commentary explains our
    view of their contribution and develops new questions and
    directions for future research that this perspective implies.




Introduction
The intent of the paper by Joo et al. (2022) is to provide a better under-
standing of the financial value of star performers. To accomplish their
goal, they use various processes for computing the value of employee
performance (SDy), which are then incorporated into utility analyses. The
authors offer a number of conclusions from their paper, including that
their ‘overall empirical finding was that HRM creates greater financial
value by obtaining more stars’ (p. 29), that their ‘results highlight the
need to use utility analysis procedures that more fully consider the pres-
ence of stars’ (p. 27), and that ‘extant procedures often significantly
underestimated the value brought by obtaining more stars’ (p. 27). We
do not dispute the analytical approach or mathematical findings from

Joo et al. (2022); in fact, we applaud them. We argue, however, that the
empirical findings from Joo et al. (2022) are unsuited for making claims
about the validity of the proposed methods. That said, what we see
instead is a larger contribution: one that speaks to how research can
develop more precise theory about the nature of employee performance.
   The Joo et al. (2022) paper provides a series of approaches that esti-
mate the extent to which differences in performance have financial impli-
cations for organizations. In the set of techniques known as utility
analysis, the key parameter SDy is defined as the dollar value of a one
standard deviation difference in the criterion (Boudreau, 1991; Cascio
et al., 2019). As originally defined, this parameter assumes that the orga-
nizational value contributed by employees is normally distributed. As Joo
et al. (2022) appropriately criticize, this assumption conflicts with key
advances in the study of job performance: there exist star performers
who produce disproportionally larger amounts of output compared to
their peers (e.g. Asgari et al., 2021; Kehoe et al., 2018; Morris et al.,
2021; O’Boyle & Aguinis, 2012; Taylor & Bendickson, 2021) thus making
the distribution of job performance non-normal (Aguinis et al., 2016;
O’Boyle & Kroska, 2017). Consequently, Joo et al. (2022) employ various
methods of computing SDy to represent the idea that the value from
employee performance is non-normal and in particular is influenced by
the substantial contributions of star employees. The methods they use, in
order of their presentation, give greater heed to this non-normality.
   Through a large number of demonstrations of utility analysis calcula-
tions, varying a number of parameters and contrasting the results from
the different methods for estimating SDy, the authors conclude that stars
do contribute greater value because the method of SDy that best incor-
porates the non-normality of actual performance scores—the method
they call the ‘observed distribution procedure’—produces notably higher
estimates of workforce utility. We argue that this conclusion is not sup-
ported; at the same time, we do not say it is falsified nor do we claim
that it is incorrect. Rather, we argue that there is simply no way to val-
idate the financial predictions made by these utility analyses. This is a
limitation of the utility analysis technique (Sturman, 2012) and not a
particular fault of the Joo et al. (2022) paper. On the other hand, the
contribution we feel that is truly made here is that the authors provide
a critical step to develop and refine a strong theory of employee perfor-
mance value that is indeed a major contribution to research on star
employees, employee value, employee performance, and utility analysis.
Their work provides a more specified theoretical structure that informs
a computational model (cf., Ballard et al., 2021; Harrison et al., 2007),
demonstrating the implications of non-normality in performance ratings
at the organizational level. In other words, we argue that Joo et al. (2022)

make an interesting and highly valuable contribution because they refine
theory of the value of employee performance and use that information
through an application of computational modeling to enhance the field’s
understanding of the implications of that theory.


Refinement of a strong theory of job performance
The idea that employee performance has value and that this value var-
ies across employees is a fundamental assumption of the driving para-
digm of human resource research. This idea speaks to why it is
important to study employee performance and performance measure-
ment; it also explains why there is potential value in investments in the
workforce in general and in some valued employees in particular.
Although this assumption is rarely explicitly stated, it must be accepted
if one is seeking to understand how firms create and capture value
from employee job performance (Barney & Clark, 2007; Bowman &
Ambrosini, 2000; Call & Ployhart, 2021; Lepak et al., 2007; Sundaram
& Inkpen, 2004).
   The explicit modeling of employee value, though, is far less com-
mon. Examples include calculating differences in value from ‘good’ ver-
sus ‘poor’ employees (Tiffin, 1942) or otherwise providing a linear
function to convert employee performance or productivity into a dollar
value (Brogden & Taylor, 1950, Schmidt & Kaplan, 1971). These means
of converting information about employee job performance to a spe-
cific metric of value (e.g. dollars, euros, yuan), however, have gone
untested (Sturman, 2012). In the spirit of the long-articulated (e.g.
Meehl, 1967, 1978) and often reiterated (e.g. Edwards & Berry, 2010;
Meehl, 1990) view that management theory should increase its preci-
sion, Sturman (2012) called for greater attention to making explicit the
idea of employee value, using theory to improve such estimates, refin-
ing methodological tools to examine such estimates, and ultimately
using these estimates to develop theoretical models of employee out-
comes. A key contribution of Joo et al. (2022) is that it actually pro-
vides a refined estimate of employee value creation, driven by the
theoretical and empirical contributions of research on ‘star performers’
(e.g. Joo et al., 2017; Kehoe et al., 2018). Joo et al. (2022) then use this
improved model of employee value creation to inform and specify the
implications of the human resource effort of acquiring more star
performers.
   As Joo et al. (2022) well note, the ‘classic’ utility analysis formula
(Brogden, 1949; Cronbach & Gleser, 1965) includes a linear transforma-
tion of employee performance scores into financial terms. This is accom-
plished using the metric known as SDy, which represents the financial

value of an employee who performs one standard deviation above aver-
age (Boudreau, 1991; Cascio et al., 2019).

                  =U N S SD y r           − N AC A                          (1)
                                        p
   This equation provides the utility formula for evaluating a selection
context. In the formula, U = financial value of using the selection device;
NS = number of applicants selected; r = validity coefficient for the selec-
tion device; p = proportion of applicants acquired (i.e. the selection ratio)
while assuming top-down acquisition; ∅ = ordinate (i.e. height) of a nor-
mal curve associated with the selection ratio; NA = number of applicants;
                                             φ
and CA = cost per applicant. The ratio ( ) provides the average value,
                                             p
expressed in standardized units, of those selected,   which is based on the
assumption that the quality of applicants on the selection test follows a
                                                       φ
normal distribution. Then, the product of r and ( ) provides the pre-
dicted average job performance of those hired, expressedp    in standardized
units. Thus, multiplying this product by SDy (which is the value of
employee performance expressed in standardized units) provides the
value gained, on average, from each selected individual. Although Joo
et al. (2022) demonstrate the implications of non-normally distributed
performance value due to the presence of stars for a selection context,
the implications of their approach are applicable to utility analytic eval-
uations of any sort of human resource practice, such as in compensation
(e.g. Sturman et al., 2003) or for training and development (e.g. Avolio
et al., 2010; Carretero-Gómez & Cabrera, 2012).
   As this basic description of the mathematics shows, there are assump-
tions made about the nature of the utility analysis parameters. By its
definition and how it is employed in the above formula, SDy assumes
both a linear transformation between performance and value and nor-
mality of the related distributions: the distribution of scores on the selec-
tive device, the distribution of performance scores, and therefore the
resulting distribution of employee value. While many have noted this
issue as a criticism of utility analysis (e.g. Boudreau, 1991; Boudreau
et al., 1994; Cascio et al., 1992; Cronbach & Gleser, 1965; Macan &
Highhouse, 1994; Schmidt et al., 1979), Joo et al. (2022) actually take
steps to address this limitation.
   Originally, utility analysis was proposed as a tool to help make human
resource investment decisions. While this specific purpose has met with
limited success as a practitioner decision aid (cf., Latham & Whyte, 1994;
Sturman, 2000; Whyte & Latham, 1997), Sturman (2012) proposed that
utility analysis may better serve as a theoretical tool because it provides
an explicit way to model employee value yielding specific predictions.

Joo et al. (2022) have done just this. They have refined theory of employee
value by providing a new function in place of SDy where this function
is based on the advancement in the human resource literature that star
employees exist and employee performance does not follow a normal
distribution.
   Viewed in this way, Joo et al. (2022) provide a theory-based refine-
ment that better expresses the value associated with employee perfor-
mance given the performance distribution of a particular job. Although
not explicitly stated in such terms, the Joo et al. (2022) paper provides
a seemingly slight but ultimately impactful change to the utility formula,
replacing the constant parameter SDy with a value function. Representing
that value function as v(p), the formula changes incrementally but impor-
tantly to

                                                 ∅ 
                               U = N S v ( p ) r   − N AC A            (2)
                                                  p 

   The Joo et al. (2022) paper walks the reader through a series of value
functions that increasingly account for non-normally distributed perfor-
mance scores. Specifically, they provide four methods of computing
SDy—what we now label as v(p)—that begin to incorporate the potential
for non-normality in the performance-to-value conversion. We wish to
highlight this particular effort, as we argue it constitutes an effort to
refine the theory of employee value. So, in contrast to the simplest depic-
tion of employee value—where SDy equals a constant of 0.4 times the
average annual wage of a position—their proposed estimate is that v(p)
equals the observed standard deviation of employee performance divided
by the estimated standard deviation of performance (based on estimates
of performance at the 85th, 50th, 15th, and minimum distribution), times
1.1 times the average salary.1


Why this value function matters
The reason we highlight the introduction of a value function to the util-
ity analysis formula is because it provides a refinement to the theory of
human resource value. A theory-driven refinement of the estimation of
employee utility shows that consideration of the non-normality of
employee performance yields substantially different estimates of work-
force value by an average factor of 9.08 (nearly a single order of magni-
tude). Showing that utility analysis estimates can be bigger is itself not a
major contribution, considering that a key criticism of the basic utility
analysis formula is it yields estimates that are likely far too large anyway

(Sturman, 2000). The contribution here comes from the new research
questions that can be considered with a revised, more precise estimate of
the employee value function.
   With this new value function, Joo et al. (2022) examine the value
associated with obtaining more star performers. More notably, they delve
into the pattern of the value function associated with different propor-
tions of stars based on distinct distributional assumptions. By comparing
differences in value obtained by the implementation of the various value
functions, Joo et al. (2022) show that productive stars add great financial
value to the organization and there exist diminishing returns for focusing
on obtaining the most productive stars. It is only by contrasting these
different value functions that they are able to reach this conclusion, thus
showing that having a more precise theory of employee value informs
new research possibilities.


Utility analysis as computational modeling rather than decision aid
We have argued that the Joo et al. (2022) paper, by presenting a formal
model based on theoretical reasoning, provides a demonstration on how
utility analysis can serve a theoretical purpose for articulating how
human resource practices influence individual performance thereby hav-
ing an influence on organizational value. Utility models, by their nature,
describe an emergence process: how individual-level employee perfor-
mance emerges as organizational-level value. The value function is the
parameter that lies at the core of how individual-level behaviors translate
to organizational-level outcomes. Furthermore, although not specifically
part of Joo et al.’s (2022) application, the longitudinal application of util-
ity analysis has long been considered (Boudreau & Berger, 1985). As
such, utility analysis models can be seen as the basis for computational
modeling (Ballard et al., 2021; Davis et al., 2007; Harrison et al., 2007).
   Computational modeling ‘is the practice of articulating theory in the
form of mathematical equations…and evaluating… theory by simulating
the model’ (Ballard et al., 2021, p. 252). In this light, refining the utility
model is refining the functions upon which a computational model can
be based. The utility models run by Joo et al. (2022) are thus actually
computational models, describing the effects of selection systems given
various parameters (the various characteristics of the selection system as
described by Joo et al. (2022) in addition to the key parameter of the
value function). For example, in the value functions—labeled as v(p) in
Equation 2 above—Joo et al. (2022) incorporate the effects caused by
non-normality in employee performance. They also demonstrate the con-
sistency of their implications by varying a set of other parameters in
their modeling. The computational modeling Joo et al. (2022) employ

allows them to reveal the overall trend of their findings; it also allows
further investigation into how sensitive their results are to other param-
eters in their model (Sturman, 2000). While the computational model
they employ is fairly simple—it is static, based on fairly straight-forward
arithmetic operations, and does not consider performance or utility over
time—it is still an instance of how the utility analysis tool can be applied
to computational modeling, and thus how computational models can
provide particular conclusions.
   Going forward, utility analysis can be used to create more complex—
and thus hopefully more theoretically interesting and accurate—compu-
tational models. Again, we recognize that it was not Joo et al.’s (2022)
purpose to demonstrate such an application; rather, we see that what
they have done has great potential in this area and presents perhaps the
first effort to make such a demonstration, purposefully or not. Taking
into account all of the utility analysis enhancements for future efforts
would certainly reach a level of complexity that would be made easier
with computer modeling (Sturman, 2000, 2003). Computational model-
ing is increasingly advocated as a method for developing and testing
complex theories (e.g. Ballard et al., 2021; Ballard et al., 2016; Harrison
et al., 2007; Vancouver et al., 2020), and there have certainly been many
complex developments that have been proposed to the basic utility model
(e.g. Boudreau, 1983a; Boudreau, 1983b; Boudreau & Berger, 1985; De
Corte, 1994; Murphy, 1986). Joo et al. (2022) present a new complex
component—the value function—to the utility model, yet one that is
driven by theoretical developments related to job performance rather
than contextual aspects of the human resource intervention being exam-
ined. Including a more complex value function with the host of other
utility analysis refinements would provide an improved theoretical model
rather than a better practitioner-oriented decision aid.


Other contributions and new research directions
Beyond its potential contributions to computational modeling, when one
considers Joo et al. (2022) through the lens of a paper contributing to
our understanding of the performance value function, the paper’s impli-
cations for future research increase. While a key contribution of the Joo
et al. (2022) study is that it takes one set of key findings from human
resource management research (i.e. the literature on star performers) and
uses that literature to refine the estimate of employee value, there are
many other findings in human resource management research that could
similarly be examined to consider their implications for employee value.
This includes work on teams, dynamic performance, performance and
turnover, citizenship and counterproductive work behaviors, and likely


--- PAGE BREAK ---

                  The International Journal of Human Resource Management   2589


many others. Despite the long-held pervasive but implicit assumption of
the existence of employee value and some sort of employee value func-
tion, there have been essentially no efforts to articulate the specific pro-
cess. As argued by Sturman (2012), ‘it is time to be explicit about
employee value’ (p. 782). Certainly, this can provide value for utility
analyses’ application to computational modeling, and it has value for
understanding the role of job performance as well. Although it may not
have been their original intent, we applaud the Joo et al. (2022) paper’s
contributions in this area. There are also several ways in which the esti-
mates from Joo et al. (2022) could be further refined.
   While the focus of Joo et al.’s (2022) effort was understandably on the
specification of SDy, the rest of the utility function remained in its sim-
plest form. Utility analysis work, however, has provided a large array of
refinements to the basic utility analysis formula that influence its estima-
tions (Sturman, 2000). The refinement of SDy is a critical step, but the
implementation of a fully complex utility model could potentially provide
more accurate insights into the value associated with human resource
practices given the presence of star employees.
   Joo et al. (2022) also show the value in questioning distributional
assumptions. A key point made in Joo et al. (2022) is that, evidenced by
the literature on star performers as well as the data they used in this
paper and elsewhere (Joo et al., 2017; O’Boyle & Aguinis, 2012), perfor-
mance does not follow a normal distribution; thus, the fundamental
assumption of SDy is flawed. That said, there is reason to delve further
into this issue. First, most notably, SDy actually does not assume that the
performance distribution of those hired follows a normal distribution;
rather, it assumes that the distribution of performance if all applicants
were hired (or if people are hired randomly) follows a normal distribu-
tion. The data upon which Joo et al. (2017, 2022) question the normality
assumption is the performance of people already in a specific profession.
Take for example the number of publications (a metric used in a large
number of their samples). The individuals in the specific professions that
actually seek to publish in their top five field-specific journals are not a
random sampling of the workforce. Rather it is quite a small subset.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2021), only 2% of the U.S. popu-
lation aged 18 and over have a Ph.D. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2021). If only
looking at the top 2% of a normal distribution, summary statistics of that
subset would have substantial skewness (skew = 1.52) and kurtosis (kur-
tosis = 2.86). Having a more restricted sample would only lead to more
skew and kurtosis. Thus, one should expect to find even greater skew in
samples that are even more restricted, such as when looking at outcomes
like home runs from major league ball players (which represents 1,026
individuals total from the applicable workforce, a ratio far less than 1%).

   Second, as acknowledged by Joo et al. (2022), they use objective mea-
sures of job performance (e.g. number of some performance metrics like
publications, chapters, presentations, patents, etc.). As such, the nature of
these metrics typically creates a lower bound (i.e. 0). Objective measures
of job performance are also more subject to influences of shocks and
events outside of the individual’s control and thus are more affected by
transient error than are subjective ratings (Sturman et al., 2005). It is
clear from the Joo et al. (2017, 2022) data that the performance mea-
sures, particularly when looking at objective measures from highly selec-
tive occupations, are not normally distributed. Because the nature of the
performance distribution has critical implications for developing a more
precise value function, Joo et al. (2022) highlight the need for more work
considering the implications of the performance distribution on the func-
tionality of utility analysis equations to further enhance the accuracy of
utility models.
   Another key direction for future research revealed by our perspective
of the Joo et al. (2022) article is that the need exists to develop ways to
test the validity of utility models. As we noted earlier, the estimates pro-
vided by Joo et al. (2022) are purely hypothetical, albeit theoretically
driven by implications of research on performance stars. The conclusions
drawn in the paper, although not validated, speak to the theoretical impli-
cations of skewed performance outcomes. This certainly is not a flaw, as
indeed our field has journals specifically devoted to theoretical papers.
Nonetheless, the most useful theories are ones that can be tested and
further refined (cf., Meehl, 1967, 1978, 1990). Utility analysis provides a
mechanism to create strong theory, with very specific predictions about
the consequences of organizational human resource policies and practices
(Sturman, 2012). Enhancing utility analysis based on findings from other
areas of human resource management research—like Joo et al. (2022) do
with research on star performers—provides a specific articulation of the
impact that human resource practices are predicted to have. While we
advocate one line of research further develops and refines that theoretical
model, another line of research considering how to test, validate, and
improve that model could prove exceptionally valuable as well.


Conclusion
Joo et al. (2022) provide a valuable, first-of-its-kind demonstration of a
theoretically driven utility-based model, yielding specific predictions and
implications about human resource policy. Although there certainly have
been prior examples of utility analysis demonstrations (e.g. Boudreau,
1991; De Corte, 1994; Schmidt et al., 1979; Sturman et al., 2003), Joo et al.
(2022) is the first demonstration of which we are aware that refines utility

analysis based on theory to estimate implications through a computational
model. If we have one criticism of the Joo et al. (2022) paper, it is only
that it does not go far enough. We therefore hope others will see Joo et al.
(2022) as an example to follow to consider how refined, research-based
value functions can alter our predictions about human resource policy.
Certainly, this is truly a muted criticism; no research can do all things,
and the Joo et al. (2022) paper thus leaves the reader with several prom-
ising paths for a type of research that has been called for (Sturman, 2012)
but heretofore been undelivered. A key point of our commentary is that
the Joo et al. (2022) paper is really the first to delve into this process of
altering an explicit employee value function, and thus their work is a valu-
able starting point for hopefully much future research in this area.


Note
 1.    In Joo et al.’s (2022) procedures, their approach (referred to as the “global proce-
       dure”) is based on differences between the 85th, 50th, 15th, and minimum percen-
       tiles, and then further simplified based on the overall average finding reported in
       Burke and Frederick (1986) that the ratio of SDy to SDO is an average of 2.75.
       They then multiply this by the estimate of SDy using the 40% rule (where SDy =
       0.4 * mean salary), and thus their estimate from the global procedure ultimately
       equals (2.75 * 0.4 * mean salary =) 1.1 * mean salary.
