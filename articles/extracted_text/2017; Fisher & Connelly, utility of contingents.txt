                          Although many managers assume that the use of contingent workers helps organizations lower
                          their costs, it is unclear if these anticipated savings actually materialize once these workers’
                          productivity and indirect costs are taken into account. The purpose of this paper is to identify
                          the conditions under which contingent workers may (or may not) be a cost-effective solution for
                          organizations. We develop a theoretical framework of the financial costs and benefits of three
                          different contingent work arrangements, taking into account direct and indirect costs as well as
                          the value of both task performance and organizational citizenship behaviors. This framework
                          suggests that costs associated with lower performance and higher turnover substantially re-
                          duce the overall value of temporary agency workers. We then use a simulation approach with
                          six scenarios representing different organizational strategies to examine how organizational
                          circumstances may further affect the likelihood that the use of contingent workers actually
                          represents a significant cost savings. Our results suggest that although temporary workers were
                          less cost-effective (and independent contractors were more cost-effective) in each scenario, the
                          cost-effectiveness of each worker type also varies depending on the strategy, with the “Temp-
                          to-Perm” approach being most cost-effective overall.

                Fisher and Connelly’s cost-benefit simulation is that it undermines simple homilies such
