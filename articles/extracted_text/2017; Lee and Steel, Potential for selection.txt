       The Potential of Good Selection: Simulating the Impact of Improved
                                            Applicant Matching on GDP

                                         By COLIN I.S.G. LEE AND PIERS STEEL*

         We estimate the potential GDP impact of increased sophistication during personnel
         selection and the better use of human capital. In our simulations of the US labor
         market, selection practices modelled after the standards of selection from 2015
         contributed between $1.77 billion (15.2%) and $3.02 trillion (25.84%) to GDP over
         random selection. A full-scale selection system, using assessments on General
         Mental Ability and the Big Five personality factors, further added $831 billion
         (7.12%) to $1.41 trillion (12.08%). Finally, a system using the estimated ideal test
         battery added $1.10 (9.44%) to $1.86 trillion (15.96%) over the simulation of
         selection practices from 2015.

   The immense benefits of maximizing the value of human capital is among economics’ first
observations, stretching back to Adam Smith. Specifically, his insight was the productivity benefits
brought through the division of labor; as people specialize and increase in expertise, efficiency
also increases. However, efficiency grows not only by specialization, but also by the choice of
specialization; innate individual differences contribute to performance over and above job training
and experience (David Z. Hambrick and Elizabeth J. Meinz, 2011, James J. Heckman and Tim
Kautz, 2012). Those blessed with superior dexterity, endurance or intelligence would ideally be
placed where these natural talents could be used to full effect. Consequently, our dinners may
arrive through the self-interest instead of the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker,
but the quality of that dinner depends partly on an individual’s choice of vocation. Even after years
of training and experience, variation among innate talents ensures there remains good bakers and
butchers as well as bad ones.

  Making optimal matches between job candidates and positions is hindered by informational
asymmetry, particularly adverse selection as per George A. Akerlof’s (1978) “Market for
Lemons.” Though self-awareness is itself imperfect, job applicants still know more about
themselves than their potential employers, or in Andrew Weiss’ (1980) terms, “firms have
imprecise information concerning the labor endowment of particular worker” (542). This
contributes to reduce mobility and frictional unemployment, as employers are less willing to accept
the risk of unclear matches (Bruce C. Greenwald, 1986). Consequently, personnel assessment,
such as work samples or personality assessment, help mitigate informational asymmetry,
potentially boosting economic output. As a further benefit, if done well, with a focus on expected
turnover and productivity, assessment minimizes group biases that create adverse impact, where
people are discriminated based on non-performance criteria such as race or religion (James L.
Outtz, 2010).
  Despite their importance, typical selection practices could be far better. A half century ago, Ross
Stagner (1958) documented “The Gullibility of Personnel Managers,” where employers were
typically unable to identify and utilize effective selection practices. Today, this lack of
sophistication continues, with a strong preference for “intuition-based hiring,” where they rely on
subjective, “gut feelings” over more objective, analytic methods. This results in the most popular
selection method also being among the least effective: the unstructured job interview (Dirk D.
Steiner, 2012). Consequently, considerable improvements can be made in the labor market, with
Robert E. Ployhart (2012) arguing that decades of advancement in the selection sciences are not
being exploited and there is a huge gap between what has been developed and what is used.

                        I. Estimating the Potential of Selection Science

  In this paper, we estimate the value in the US labor market that is still trapped due to suboptimal
selection techniques, drawing on an inter-disciplinary approach as advocated by Janice C Molloy
and Jay Bryan Barney (2015). Using a detailed simulation of the US labor market, we examine
the extent to which increased sophistication in personnel assessment could improve productivity
and, subsequently, GDP.
  Estimating the economic impact of selection techniques has a long history, going back to Hubert
E. Brogden (1949), who applied cost accounting to personnel selection. Referred to as “utility
equations,” Brogden calculated the benefits of selection as primarily a multiplicative function of:


--- PAGE BREAK ---

                                                                                                   3


1.) the relationship between the selection test and performance, 2.) the increased productivity of
an individual performing at one standard deviation above the mean, and 3.) the average
standardized test score of those selected from the applicant pool. Thus, as we become better at
predicting performance, as the difference between an average and a superior performer becomes
more valuable, and as we become pickier or more selective (i.e., increasing the average test score),
the worth of our selection system increases. If we cannot predict, if individuals are largely
interchangeable, or we must hire everyone who applies, our selection system becomes worthless.
  Estimates of the benefits of selection at a national level, though, have been controversial. The
U.S. Department of Labor Department requested that the National Research Council investigate
the benefits of broader adoption for selection of an extremely well validated test, the General
Aptitude Test Battery (GATB). As Richard P. Phelps (1999) documents, a committee of education
professors was formed, who “claimed flatly that there are no job selection benefits to testing
because the U.S. labor market is a zero-sum game” (38). They argued that when multiple firms are
competing for the same employees, there is no net benefit as a good hire for one company leads to
a direct reduction in the quality of candidates available for another. Of note, despite “the zero-
sum” description, this is notably different from the lump of labor fallacy. The lump of labour refers
to the idea that there is limited amount of job positions available, which has been used to argue
against the inclusion of women or immigrants to the labor force.
  As applied to selection, the zero-sum argument is also fallacious, making sense under five
overlapping conditions. First, we would need to assume that those unemployed or underemployed
would not be able to add any value to the economy, which would happen only if there was perfect
selection. If there are people unemployed who are superior to those holding a job, productivity
would improve if these individuals exchanged places. Second, we would need to assume that the
attributes to excel in every position in every company are identical. On the other hand, if the
requirements for a sales or customer service position are different from the requirements for
lawyers or surgeons, there is opportunity for improved matching. Third, we need to assume that
all jobs are equally valuable. Increases in productivity can arise due to “allocative efficiency,"
where we channel those with most skill where they are most needed. For example, Christopher
Langan, whose IQ is among the highest recorded, had a long stint as a bouncer on Long Island.
Though he may have been an outstanding bouncer, arguably, his cognitive talents may have been
better utilized elsewhere. Fourth, the zero-sum argument adopts a form of “The Just World

                                                                                                    4


Hypothesis” (M. J. Lerner, 1980), where there is no racism or sexism or bias against any group
based on non-performance related characteristics. If we acknowledge that bias exists, then good
selection practices can partner in minimizing it while improving overall productivity. Fifth, the
zero-sum argument could be maintained under the condition that we are all inter-changeable, what
might be described as “The Clone Army Hypothesis.”
  Given the implausibility of any one of these five conditions, there has been an early attempt at
providing a national estimate of the benefits of selection . Though somewhat rudimentary, based
on using just four occupational groups (i.e., professional, skilled, clerical and unskilled) with a
simplified selection model based on a single general ability factor, they applied Brogden’s (1949)
utility equations to the 1980 U.S. economy. Among several scenarios, they estimated an increase
to the U.S. GDP of 15.8%, or approximately $453 billion in 2017 dollars, compared to random
selection.
  Over the ensuing decades, a series of selection and simulation advances have occurred. In
particular, the development of synthetic validity has matured, where validated selection systems
can be synthesized from predetermined correlations with job components almost instantly and at
negligible cost (Piers Steel et al., 2006, Piers Steel et al., 2010). Previously, the development of
full-scale selection system was prohibitively complicated and costly that it was primarily the
purview of large institutions with jobs that held positions for hundreds or more. Also, with today’s
digitalization of applicant data (Eric M. Dunleavy et al., 2008, Paul A. Gilster et al., 2001) and the
use of digital footprints in assessment (e.g., Wu Youyou et al., 2015), the unit cost of administering
selection tests is approaching zero. This has substantially lowered the threshold to algorithm-,
equation-, or automation-based recruitment and selection (Corissa Leong, 2018, Dianna L. Stone
et al., 2015). Given that the benefits of mass improvements in selection are now readily realizable,
the importance of verifying the 1980 figure is timely. If the 15.8% improvement still holds, that
translates into over three trillion dollars in added productivity.

                                    II. Simulation Components

  The elements required to simulate the effect of selection on an economy are A.) applicants, B.)
vacancies, C.) a method to match these applicants and vacancies, and D.) a technique that allows
productivity to be estimated for the selected applicants and, successively, the impact on the
economy’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Before showing how these elements function in

                                                                                                  5


unison in a simulation of the U.S. labor market in 2015, we will explain how each separate element
was generated. At every step, we focused on the U.S. economy in the year 2015 specifically, by
using data from that year for aspects that unmistakably vary over time.

                                         A. The Labor Force

  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 153,763,688 individuals in the
workforce in 2015. Of these, a little over 5% was unemployed (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016).
We recreated this workforce in a Monte-Carlo simulation including, for each worker, the key
characteristics that are traditionally required to estimate the individual’s performance in an
occupation.
  In applicant selection, intelligence and personality are generally recognized as the most
important predictors across occupations (e.g., In-Sue Oh et al., 2015, Frank L. Schmidt and John
E. Hunter, 1992, 2004, 1998). We gave our population scores on these characteristics by providing
each individual a score such that the population has the same mean, standard deviation, and overall
distribution, as was found in prior meta-analytic studies on General Mental Ability (GMA; Ute R.
Hülsheger et al., 2007) and the Big Five personality measures (Timothy A. Judge et al., 2013, John
P. Meriac et al., 2008), for intelligence and personality respectively. To ensure that the
combinations of values reflect those found in the workforce, we spawn the distribution of the
values across the workforce from a matrix containing the mean, corrected, correlations (i.e., 𝜌) and
the corresponding standard deviations (i.e., 𝑠𝑑𝜌 ) between the characteristics. This Monte-Carlo
process (similar to Patrick D. Converse and Frederick L. Oswald, 2014) results in a sample with
correlations and score distributions on GMA and personality, that are effectively indistinguishable
from those observed in the prior studies that the selected meta-analyses draw from.

                                     B. Occupations and Jobs

  Data on the mean salary per occupation (used to establish productivity, as will be explained
later) and number of available jobs per occupation for the year 2015 were retrieved from the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016). The data on the characteristics of
the occupations in the U.S. labor market were obtained from the Occupational Network Online
(O*NET), a platform created and managed by the U.S. Department of Labor (for a summary see
Norman G. Peterson et al., 2001).


--- PAGE BREAK ---

                                                                                                   6


  O*NET provides numerous data tables with detailed descriptions of occupations. We used two
sources of job characteristics data in particular. The main source was the O*NET listing of General
Work Activities (GWAs). The use of GWAs for synthetic matching was recommended by Rodney
A. McCloy et al. (2010). We simplified the process by reducing the 42 O*NET GWAs into the 3
well-established job components of “Data,” “People”, and “Things” – an approach supported by
prior factor analytic work (Sidney A. Fine and Steven F. Cronshaw, 1999, Shanan G. Gibson et
al., 2007, Theresa M. Glomb et al., 2004). “Data” focuses on problem solving and dealing with
information (e.g., “thinking creatively”), “People” focuses on interpersonal relations (e.g.,
“training and teaching others”), and “Things” involves physical manipulation (e.g., “handling and
moving objects”).
  Expanding on Data, People, and Things, Rustin D. Meyer et al. (2009) and Rustin D. Meyer et
al. (2014) developed the additional components of “Constraints” and “Consequences.” The
constraints component is defined as “the amount of behavioral/decisional restriction placed on an
employee or, conversely, as the amount of autonomy or latitude an employee experiences” (Rustin
D. Meyer, Reeshad S. Dalal and Silvia Bonaccio, 2009). Consequences is defined as “the presence
of contingencies between one’s decisions or behaviors and the outcomes accruing to oneself, other
employees, the organization as a whole, and/or external stakeholders” (Rustin D. Meyer, Reeshad
S. Dalal and Silvia Bonaccio, 2009). Most items for these two components came from a second
source, the O*NET work context table.

                                      C. The Selection System

  To simulate the evaluation of individuals in applicant selection and to estimate how individuals
in the labor force would perform within specific occupations, we built a Synthetic Validity selection
system. Synthetic Validity determines the weights of the performance indicators for an occupation
by calculating how the weights vary (i.e., are moderated) by work activities and context (Jeff W
Johnson et al., 2010, Piers Steel, Jeff W. Johnson, P. Richard Jeanneret, Charles A. Scherbaum,
Calvin C. Hoffman and Jeff Foster, 2010). Essentially, by examining the task or conditions that
comprise a job, we can estimate who would be best to fill the position (i.e., “From the Work One
Knows The Worker”). As a rudimentary example, general mental ability is more important for
performance in complex jobs that require considerable problem solving (i.e., higher in the Data
component). Once we know the magnitude of that effect and the general mental ability score of


--- PAGE BREAK ---

                                                                                                      7


applicants, we can get a first estimate of their performance. This can then be extended by including
other indicators and taking into consideration the overlap between these indicators (i.e.,
intercorrelations).
  In the simulation, each occupation has been scored on the extent to which the job components
Data, People, Things, Constraints, and Consequences are required or needed to perform the
occupation. As described, these scores were retrieved from the O*NET database. Knowing the
activities performed in each occupation, we only needed to determine how the validity coefficients
for each predictor (GMA and each of the Big Five personality components) correlated with those
activities (reduced to the job components Data, People, Things, Constraints, and Consequences),
to establish occupation-specific regression equations.
  Validity Estimates —To determine how the validity coefficients of the predictors correlated with
the job components, we relied on 54 subject matter experts, personnel selection scholars and
practitioners from the field of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, and an elaborate
assessment environment. Prior studies using clinical or expert predictions within applied
psychology and medicine, have shown that subject matter expert estimates are typically accurate
and robust (William M. Grove et al., 2000). In a comparison of subject matter expert estimates of
validity coefficients in applicant selection with coefficients derived through ordinary least squares
regression, O’Neill and Steel (2018) reveal that we would need validation and job analysis data
from at least 185 jobs to provide an estimate as precise as that by 10 experts. That is, the uncertainty
of empirical estimations due to sampling error is evenly matched by the subject matter experts’
imprecision (i.e., both forms of estimation create correlations that are within .04 of the true 50%
of the time). Notably, we relied on 51 subject matter experts for our estimates in the present study.
The initial sample consisted of 54 experts, but 3 were excluded because they failed to follow the
instructions and provided multiple estimates outside the specified ranges. Also, the 185 jobs
represent level 2 of a multi-level model, with level 1 being the selection system for the individual
jobs, each of which, if empirically derived, would essentially be a separate study composed of data
from hundreds of employees. Consequently, the data derived here is equivalent to some of largest
studies ever attempted in the personnel selection sciences (Piers Steel et al., 2006).
  In order to ensure high data quality, we followed the procedure for online subject matter expert
estimation of Synthetic Validity job component correlates, as outlined in detail by Rodney A.
McCloy, Dan J. Putka and Robert E. Gibby (2010). We then refined the approach by restricting

                                                                                                     8


the experts’ estimates to ranges that were viable statistically, considering the known meta-analytic
distributions of the validity coefficients from the 𝜌 and 𝑠𝑑𝜌 values reported by Ute R. Hülsheger,
Günter N. W. Maier and Thorsten Stumpp (2007), Timothy A. Judge, Jessica B. Rodell, Ryan L.
Klinger, Lauren S. Simon and Eean R. Crawford (2013), and John P. Meriac, Brian J. Hoffman,
David J. Woehr and Matthew S. Fleisher (2008). With this we arrived at informed, conditional
estimates using Meta-Analytic Assisted Subjective Estimation. For a full explanation of the
procedure, see Appendix A. Job Specific Assessment Equations —In order to derive job-specific
equations that would be used in the assessment of an applicant for a specific vacancy, we used the
latest approach to Synthetic Validity as described by Piers Steel, Allen I. Huffcutt and John
Kammeyer-Mueller (2006) and demonstrated by Piers Steel and John Kammeyer-Mueller (2009).
When incorporating subject matter expert estimates instead of empirical weights, the approach
consists of roughly three stages.
  First, the means of the scaled subject matter expert estimates for the second-order correlations
(i.e., correlations between predictor’s validity coefficients and the job components) were used in
six separate OLS regression (one for each predictor), to obtain a regression equation that allows
the validity coefficients of each predictor to be estimated from an occupation’s job components.
Second, these regression equations were used to estimate the job-specific validity coefficients for
each of the 874 O*NET occupations listed with full data on O*NET – this excludes 20 O*NET
occupations that are specific to the military, 124 occupations that serve as general or rest categories
(e.g., “Engineers, All Other”), and 82 occupations for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics does
not keep employment data (e.g., “Baristas”, “Endoscopy Technicians”, “Chief Sustainability
Officers”). In the third and final step, these job-specific validity coefficients were entered into a
correlation matrix containing the correlations between the predictors (i.e., as in Table 1 in Piers
Steel, Allen I. Huffcutt and John Kammeyer-Mueller, 2006) and OLS was applied with job
performance (i.e., the validity coefficients) as the outcome variable. This provided a unique,
synthetic, regression equation for each occupation that allows job performance to be predicted
from GMA and the Big Five personality factors.

                                        D. Estimating Impact

  We seek to estimate the potential of selection, a scenario where geographic mobility and
educational opportunities are not substantive limiting factors. When the simulation runs, the


--- PAGE BREAK ---

                                                                                                  9


people in the labor force apply for jobs and go through a selection process, where they are tested
on their intelligence and personality. Using the job specific synthetic equation, this provides an
overall job performance score for the individual on the specific occupation. Since this is our best
estimate of the individual’s performance, we take this value as the objective score (i.e., supposed
“true” performance score) to which we add pseudo-random values with a Gaussian distribution
(i.e., “random noise”), with a weight that replicates the variance explained (i.e., R 2) of the
regression equation, to reach a predicted performance score of the individual in an application
process.
  The predicted performance scores are used to allocate people to jobs. After all candidates have
been tested, the candidate with the highest score is offered the position. Consistent with the high
weight given to salary in job choice (e.g., Derek S. Chapman et al., 2005), individuals respond to
incentives and take the job with the highest pay.

  Baseline selection system —To simulate the selection proficiency and productivity levels found
in the 2015 labor market (i.e., ∆𝑼𝒃𝒂𝒔𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆), we first recreated the natural selection effects. Here,
this term refers to selection effects that occur before people apply to jobs, which includes
everything from parental influence to educational choice. As per several theories of occupational
choice, job applicant pools are not random draws from the population but reflect some inherent
matching (Seung-Ming Leung, 2008). For example, in order to become an engineer, one needs to
graduate from an engineering school, which serves as an indirect filter for the selection process
(Christopher M Berry et al., 2006). After having recreated naturally occurring selection, we
included selection effects of contemporary selection practices.
  Natural selection was simulated by making the average ratio between the Standard Deviation
(SD) of GMA within the applicant pools and SD of GMA across the population equal to the ratio
observed within applicant pool statistics. Such ratios are known as SD ratios (Deniz S. Ones and
Chockalingam Viswesvaran, 2003, Paul R. Sackett and Daniel J. Ostgaard, 1994), reflecting
between and within group variance. The SD ratio of GMA indicates the possible extent of natural
selection, as it reduces when people choose or are sorted into occupations for which they are
comparatively well-suited. For example, random selection would indicate that within group
variance is the same as between group variance, creating an SD ratio of one.

                                                                                                    10


  The SD ratio for the contemporary labor market was established using applicant pool statistics
from a widely-used GMA assessment test, the Wonderlic Personnel Test (Eldon F. Wonderlic,
2007). The ratio showed that, on average, the SD of applicant pools was 11.8% lower than the SD
across the population.
  This SD ratio was calibrated in the simulation by increasing the variance accounted for in
performance until the applicant pools in our simulation had a similar SD ratio to the ratio observed
in the contemporary labor market. This indicated that the variance accounted for by natural
selection is at most .049. This is an upper limit, since the approach builds on the conservative
assumption regarding the Gravitational Hypothesis (i.e., the attraction, selection, attrition model;
Steffanie L. Wilk et al., 1995), that all selection is to the benefit of performance. In practice, as
some of the homogeneity in applicant pools is due to non-performance related characteristics (e.g.,
Christopher D. Nye et al., 2017), there is some natural selection that does not contribute to
performance. For instance, vocational counseling often relies on self-rated abilities to help
individuals make career choices. Considering the limited relationship between self-rated abilities
and actual abilities, this can increase homogeneity in the applicant pool, without improving
performance. In this respect, the simulation is conservative as it overestimates the productivity
increase that the baseline selection practices provide over random selection and underestimates the
potential gains remaining.
  After having simulated natural selection, which would include educational requirements, we
considered the effects of selection practices used by companies. Companies commonly only use
unstructured interviews in the selection process (Dirk D. Steiner, 2012). Therefore, to replicate the
variance accounted for by the selection effects in the application process, we increased the variance
accounted for by natural selection with the variance accounted for by unstructured interviews. We
based the variance of unstructured interviews on a meta-analysis that included 39 studies and had
a combined sample size of 9,330 (i.e., .23; Michael A. McDaniel et al., 1994). We employed the
validity coefficient without the correction for range restriction (R2 = .0529), since natural selection
already accounted for range restriction effects. The combined variance accounted for by natural
selection and selection by the hiring firm at baseline was thus .1019 on average, across occupations
(R2selection = R2natural selection + R2firm selection = .049 + .0529 = .1019).

  Utility analysis —In order to compute the percentage change in productivity (∆%𝑼) when
contemporary selection is replaced by another form of selection, we used a simplified version of
the Brogden utility model (Hubert E. Brogden, 1949, 1946). First, for each simulation of a selection
system, the total dollar value change over random selection (∆𝑼) was calculated by taking the sum
total change for every occupation:

(1)                          ∆𝑼𝒏𝒆𝒘 = ∑𝑖 𝑵𝒊 ∗ 𝑺𝑫𝒀𝒊 ∗ 𝒖
                                                    ̅ 𝑿𝒊


Where for each occupation 𝒊, 𝑵𝒊 denotes the number of individuals selected, 𝑺𝑫𝒀𝒊 is the standard
                                                        ̅ 𝑿𝑖 is the mean estimated job performance
deviation in job performance in monetary units (𝒀), and 𝒖
score for those selected, where job performance was a z-score prediction from the Synthetic
Validity selection system. For 𝑺𝑫𝒀 we used both the conservative cut-off of 40% of mean salary
(which as Schmidt and Hunter report is “a lower bound value; actual values are typically
considerably higher” p. 263) and the more liberal range of 40-70% (John E. Hunter and Frank L.
Schmidt, 1982a), where the value increases proportionally with the O*NET job zone of the
occupations (John E. Hunter et al., 1990).
  Being a simulation and having a purview that goes beyond the typically obtainable components,
this approach deviates from the original Brogden model in that it uses the objective performance
                                ̅ 𝑿𝑖 ) to establish productivity, instead of inferring the productivity
scores of those selected (i.e., 𝒖
from mean predicted performance in the applicant pool. This approach enables us to model the
distributive effects of selection more precisely, since the utility for the occupation is dependent
only upon those selected and not on those in the applicant pool that were not selected.
  We established the percentage change in productivity provided by each selection system by
subtracting the value added by the contemporary system (∆𝑼𝒃𝒂𝒔𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆 ) from the value added by the
new system (∆𝑼𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒂𝒓𝒊𝒔𝒐𝒏) and dividing this by the overall utility in the current system, as

               III. Improvements in Selection: Simulating the Impact on GDP

  Figure 1 shows the results of the simulations under the conservative assumption of the effect of
job performance on productivity (i.e., 𝑆𝐷𝑌 = 40%) and the assumption that the effect of
performance on productivity varies with job complexity (i.e., 40% ≤ 𝑆𝐷𝑌 ≤ 70%). Both trend
lines show diminishing marginal returns to the economy of investments in applicant selection (i.e.,
test battery accuracy). They indicate that investments in applicant selection do lead to a substantial
net performance and productivity gain to the economy, but the performance gains diminish as
adoption increases.

                                       [ Insert Figures 1 Here ]

                                   A. Improvements in Selection

  As can be seen in Figure 1, we first established the value added of the baseline system compared
to a system in which the selection of people to occupations is completely random. The system
modelled after contemporary selection practices provided an improvement of 15.2% over random
selection, when using a conservative estimate of the effect of job performance on productivity (i.e.,
𝑆𝐷𝑌 = 40%). Since labor accounts for approximately 65% of GDP in the US (Douglas Gollin,
2002, Alexei Izyumov and John Vahaly, 2015), we can convert this to a monetary value by
multiplying the productivity increase by 65% of GDP in 2015 (i.e., $17.947 trillion; International
Monetary Fund, 2016). Thus, the productivity increase from selection practices in 2015 (including
self-selection) translates to an estimated $1.77 trillion rise in GDP (i.e., .65*17.947*.152 ≈ 1.77).
When assuming that the impact of a one deviation increase in performance leads to an increase in
productivity of up to 70% for complex occupations, these estimates rise to 25.84% and $3.02
trillion.
  Subsequently, we created a system in which every company assesses its applicants using GMA
and the Big Five personality test. In practice, the underlying algorithms could be hidden and a
company would simply be informed of the desirability to hire an applicant. In this simulation,
productivity was 7.12% higher than in the simulation of the contemporary labor market, under
conservative estimates of 𝑆𝐷𝑌 . In terms of a GDP increase this translates to $831 billion (i.e.,
$0.831 trillion). When 𝑆𝐷𝑌 varied by job complexity, the simulation indicates that a further rise of

                                                                                                13


12.08% over the 2015 baseline can be expected, which means that selection would by these
attributes would have added $1.41 trillion to the US economy.
  The consistent use of GMA and Big Five by companies seems to be the most plausible scenario
(e.g., Orlando Behling, 1998, Lewis R. Goldberg, 1999). However, one can question whether
companies would choose to base their hiring decisions on GMA and the Big Five only. Therefore,
we simulated more extensive use of applicant testing by increasing the variance explained by
selection in our simulation up to an estimated maximum possible variance that could be explained
by any combination of assessment tests. To find this maximum, we asked our panel of subject
matter experts to provide their estimates of the variance explained of the “ideal test-battery”: “…
How much variance in performance do you think we would be able to predict if every psychometric
improvement (i.e., the best measures, of the best quality) would be implemented?”
  The mean estimated variance (i.e., 𝑅2 ) of the hypothetical ideal test battery was 50.32% (N = 54
subject matter experts). To simulate the use of such assessments, we increased the 𝑅2 of the test
batteries based on GMA and the Big Five proportionally per occupation, from the original
vacancy-weighted 𝑅2 average of .3456 to the vacancy-weighted average representing the ideal
(i.e., 𝑅2 = .5032). This increased the conservative estimate vis-à-vis the contemporary system to
9.44% and a GDP increase of $1.10 trillion. When 𝑆𝐷𝑌 was contingent upon job complexity, the
increase was very similar to the original estimate by John E. Hunter and Frank L. Schmidt (1982a),
15.96% and $1.86 trillion.

                                 B. Improvements in Allocation

  In our initial simulations, we assumed that vacancies with the highest salary get first choice in
the labor market. This selection mechanism should resemble reality to a fairly high degree, as
salary is an important determinant of job choice (e.g., Derek S. Chapman, Krista L. Uggerslev,
Sarah A. Carroll, Kelly A. Piasentin and David A. Jones, 2005), but it does not provide optimal
allocative efficiency. Some individuals might be comparatively well suited for a lower paid job
such that they would contribute more to the economy if they would take the lower paid position.
  To test the extent to which allocation could improve productivity, we created a system in which
individuals are optimally allocated to vacancies through a stable allocation algorithm (David Gale
and Lloyd S. Shapley, 1962, Alvin E. Roth, 1984). The algorithm consisted of four stages. First,
companies determined the productivity of each candidate for each occupation and offered the

                                                                                                  14


available positions to the best candidates. Second, applicants retained their most attractive offer
(but deferred from accepting) and rejected the offers for jobs in which they would be less
productive. Third, the companies selected the next-best candidates for jobs on which the prior offer
was rejected. Finally, the market went through steps two and three until all of the jobs were filled.
  We first tested the increase in productivity that optimal allocation provided along with selection
on GMA and the Big Five personality factors over the 2015 baseline, under the conservative
assumption of the effect of job performance on productivity (i.e., 𝑆𝐷𝑌 = 40%). This revealed an
increase 8.02% or $936 billion (i.e., $0.936 trillion) over the 2015 baseline. When 𝑆𝐷𝑌 varied by
job complexity, the increase over the 2015 baseline was 13.44% and $1.57 trillion. Compared to
the system in which salary determined the order of allocation, ceteris paribus, the increase was
0.90% and $105 billion (i.e., $0.105 trillion) under the conservative assumption regarding 𝑆𝐷𝑌 and
1.35% and $158 billion (i.e., $0.158 trillion) otherwise.
  Next, we tested the increase that would be provided by optimal allocation in the simulation using
the ideal test battery for selection. This showed a 10.6% or $1.24 trillion increase over the 2015
baseline under the conservative assumption regarding the relationship between job performance
and productivity. When the relationship between job performance and productivity varied by job
complexity, the increase was 17.64% and $2.06 trillion. This translates to an increase of
respectively 1.16% or $136 billion (i.e., $0.136 trillion) and 1.68% or $196 billion (i.e., $0.196
trillion) over the same selection system with the market (i.e., salary) determining allocation.

                                      C. Returns to Adoption

  To provide insight into the extent to which the benefits of applicant selection decrease with
adoption, we compared the progression of average productivity in jobs relying on contemporary
selection practices versus the average productivity for jobs relying on GMA and the Big Five for
applicant selection. We chose to compare to the latter because this is the more realistic projection
of the future use of applicant selection in the labor market.

                                       [ Insert Figure 2 Here ]

  The comparison shows that early adopters indeed have substantially higher gains. When the rate
of adoption is 10% or lower, productivity is over 32.9% higher in occupations relying on the GMA
and Big Five test battery for selection in comparison to the contemporary productivity rates (i.e.,


--- PAGE BREAK ---

                                                                                                15


relying on a selection system that accounts for .1019 of the variance in productivity on average)
and 30.1% higher compared to non-adopters (i.e., occupations relying on a system with an average
efficacy similar to that of contemporary selection practices). As adoption increases, there are
diminishing marginal returns to adoption, ranging from 39.4% at 2% adoption to 7.1% at 100%
adoption in comparison to contemporary productivity rates. The “penalty” of non-adoption ranges
from -.005% at 2% to -6% and below after 50% adoption. Of note, when adoption is low, the trend
for adopters starts diverging and when adoption is high, the trend for the non-adopters ranges
because of the lower vacancy counts.

                                         IV. DISCUSSION

  This study shows the potential of employment selection in enhancing national productivity by
providing several simulations of the US labor market. We show how productivity and GDP for the
US would have improved in 2015, had every company conducted psychometric testing in applicant
selection.
  Under the most feasible conditions, where companies would test on GMA and the Big Five
personality constructs and individuals choose their occupation based on salary, productivity
improved by 7.12% to 12.08% and GDP increased by $0.831 to $1.41 trillion. When every
company would use the state of the art in applicant testing (i.e., the “ideal” test battery), the
productivity improved by 9.44% to 15.96% and GDP increased by $1.1 trillion to $1.86 trillion.
Compared to changes in applicant testing, using optimal (i.e., "stable"; David Gale and Lloyd S.
Shapley, 1962, Alvin E. Roth, 1984) allocation methods to assign individuals to occupations had
a small effect on productivity and GDP, with an improvement of 8.02% ($0.94 trillion) to 13.44%
($1.57 trillion) when testing on GDP and the Big Five and 10.6% ($1.24 trillion) to 17.64% ($2.06
trillion) when using the estimated ideal test battery.
  Given the magnitude of these estimates, it is worth reconsidering their verisimilitude. We did
not model job mobility, matching job applicants to jobs without regards to geography. The degree
that this is a concern is ameliorated when simulating at an occupational level, as a job applicant
merely needs to matched to a position within the region defined by their mobility, not a specific
firm or organization. The larger the region, such as New York’s tri-state, the more it will reflect
occupations representative of the nation as a whole. Modeling representative national sub regions
and then summating would be equifinal to our simulation.

                                                                                                  16


  In addition, we did not directly model job training or educational requirements, except for its
role in natural selection (e.g., Christopher M Berry, Melissa L Gruys and Paul R Sackett, 2006).
While education and ability are correlated, they are imperfectly so. Consequently, this simulation
reflects a country’s educational meritocracy, that is its ability to maximize its human capital in
terms of both selection and the underlying education simultaneously. This is sporadically an issue.
O*NET sorts occupations into five job zones, each reflecting a degree of preparation or training.
Level 1 and 2 require no more than a high school diploma or GED (General Equivalency Diploma)
and Level 3 requires another year or two of training. Together, they represent two-thirds of
occupations, and given that the U.S. Census Bureau indicates approximately 90% of American’s
have a high school degree or equivalent, educational requirements pose few obstacles here. The
remaining third of occupations represent level 4 and 5 jobs, which require advanced degrees that
can be expensive or difficult to obtain. To fully realize the benefits of selection, a country would
need to enable those with only a high school degree but selected for occupations in job zone level
4 or 5 to obtain the requisite education. While as a society we collectively try to minimize these
instances through vocational counselling and scholarships, as per the case of Christopher Langan,
there will be lost opportunities. While our estimates still represent the amount of human capital
untapped in the labor market, it may of interest to partial out the portion that would remain
unrealized due to a lack of educational meritocracy even with ideal selection practices.
  On the other hand, it some ways these are still conservative estimates, based on the maximal
impact of natural selection. If, for example, natural selection was midway between random
selection and its present maximal, the benefits of improved selections practices would increase by
approximately by another 500 billion annually.
  Across all simulations, the results reveal that improved selection practices provided a substantial
improvement to GDP. Nonetheless, the returns to adoption do depend on the overall rate of
adoption in the market. When adoption rates are low, returns on the use of applicant testing on
productivity can be as high as 39.9% compared to occupations not adopting the improved
practices. At near-full adoption, the benefit of adoption versus non-adoption was estimated at
11.6%.
  Consistent with simulation methodology, not all potentially relevant parameters could be
included. We did not, for instance, model indirect effects of improved selection practices. Good
selection reduces frictional unemployment, increasing the percentage of time in gainful work. It

                                                                                                17


also results in more effective vocationally counselling or self-selection, where people pursue
positions not only based on personal interests, but on realistic likelihoods of employment. This
would reduce false or errant career paths, maximizing the benefits of training and education. We
leave these as questions for future research, though notably both would further increase the
estimated benefits of improved selection. Nevertheless, our simulation estimates already provide
a good and well-substantiated indication of the impact and potential of large scale adoption of
more sophisticated approaches to applicant selection. Given we are well into an era of
interconnected and interoperable applicant data, these estimates are particularly relevant as the
underlying selection practices we modelled could readily become the default.

        APPENDIX A: META-ANALYTIC ASSISTED SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATION

  To obtain informed conditional estimates of how the validity coefficients of the predictors
correlate with the job components, we used the subject matter expert estimation approach of job
component correlates, as outlined by Rodney A. McCloy, Dan J. Putka and Robert E. Gibby
(2010). We then refined the approach by restricting the experts’ estimates to ranges that were
viable statistically, considering the known meta-analytic distributions of the validity coefficients
from the 𝜌 and 𝑠𝑑𝜌 values reported by Ute R. Hülsheger, Günter N. W. Maier and Thorsten Stumpp
(2007), Timothy A. Judge, Jessica B. Rodell, Ryan L. Klinger, Lauren S. Simon and Eean R.
Crawford (2013), and John P. Meriac, Brian J. Hoffman, David J. Woehr and Matthew S. Fleisher
(2008). With this we arrived at informed, conditional estimates using Meta-Analytic Assisted
Subjective Estimation.
  For each combination of predictor and job component, we asked the subject matter experts to
estimate what the correlation between the predictor variable and job performance would be for a
job that is one standard deviation above the mean for the job component. For instance: “For a job
that's HIGH (1 SD above the mean) on Things the correlation (r) between performance and GMA
will be:”. In agreement with Rodney A. McCloy, Dan J. Putka and Robert E. Gibby (2010), we
used a variety of stimulus materials. These materials included detailed instructions (involving a
video) to train and prepare each expert, the definitions of each job component, and a help menu
with answers to frequently asked questions and background material. In addition, for each
component, we listed relevant job components (e.g., for Things: “repairing and maintaining
equipment”, “inspecting equipment, structures, or material”, and “controlling machines and
processes”) and exemplary jobs for which the level of the component is relatively high (e.g., for
People: “healthcare practitioners”, “management occupations”, and “protective service
occupations”).
  To further ascertain the quality of the estimates, we developed a new technique, constraining the
estimates to values that could be considered feasible within the ranges found in previous meta-
analytic estimates of the mean population correlation (i.e., 𝜌) and the standard deviations of the
correlations around this mean. As depicted in Figure A1, we showed the subject matter experts
how their estimated correlation between the job component and predictor ranked in comparison to
the meta-analytic distribution of the effect of the predictor on job performance. We then instructed

them to adhere to the statistical constraints imposed by this distribution. Specifically, since we
asked the experts to provide an estimate for a job that is one standard deviation above the mean
for the job component, the estimated correlation between the predictor and job performance was
constrained to a range from one standard deviation above to one standard deviation below the
mean meta-analytic correlation 𝜌. If the estimated correlation would be smaller or bigger than 𝜌 ±
𝑠𝑑𝜌 , the correlation corresponding to the moderating effect of the job component on the correlation
between the predictor and performance (i.e., the “second-order correlation”) would be bigger or
smaller than one. A correlation, of course, cannot be bigger or smaller than one. Finally, we further
reduced the estimates to 50%, a point at which all models were positive definite, to ascertain the
viability of the estimates.
