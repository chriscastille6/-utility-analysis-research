      ABSTRACT                                                                              KEYWORDS
      We assessed the financial value of human resource manage-                             Star performers;
      ment (HRM) as a function of obtaining more star performers.                           individual performance;
      Specifically, we implemented utility analysis procedures on                           normality assumption;
                                                                                            utility analysis
      206 samples of individual performance (i.e. output) encom-
      passing 824,924 workers. We found that HRM adds greater
      financial value by obtaining more stars. Our results also offer
      several specific contributions to HRM theory. First, regarding
      how HRM produces greater value by obtaining more stars,
      our evidence points to a nonlinear model of HRM’s value,
      where HRM generates significant yet diminishing returns by
      increasingly obtaining the most productive ones. Second,
      regarding when, our results show that diminishing returns
      from HRM are stronger when output differences among top
      stars are relatively small. Third, regarding why, our study
      explains that small output differences among top stars may
      create various costs which diminish the returns from obtain-
      ing the most productive stars. Our explanation of HRM’s
      nonlinear pattern contributes to the star literature by helping
      integrate a variety of specific explanations for stars’ curvi-
      linear influence discussed in past research. Regarding HRM
      practices, we highlight the need to use utility analysis pro-
      cedures that more fully consider the existence of stars.



Star performers are workers who produce disproportionately larger
amounts of cumulative output compared to their peers (Asgari et al.,
2021; Kehoe et al., 2018; Morris et al., 2021; O’Boyle & Aguinis, 2012;
Taylor & Bendickson, 2021). A star’s output can be a dozen or more
standard deviations above the average (e.g. Veksler, 2010). Stars include
workers who manage to accumulate disproportionate amounts of output
even if there are constraints that prevent many other workers from
producing much output, creating a large gap between stars’ and non-stars’
output (Aguinis et al., 2016). In terms of prevalence, stars exist in a

wide variety of occupations such as salespeople, engineers, managers
and laborers (Aguinis et al., 2018; Crawford et al., 2015; Turetsky, 2017).
For example, one study found that 82.53% of 229 samples of worker
output had significantly heavy right-tails containing stars, as depicted
in Figure 1 (Joo et al., 2017). Not only are stars prevalent, but they
also seem to be more productive than ever before because some workers
are able to generate much larger amounts of output from technological
advances than others (Cascio & Montealegre, 2016), further widening
the output gap between stars and non-stars. In particular, the Internet
now allows workers to access valuable information with greater ease,
communicate with clients and coworkers on a more frequent basis, and
work longer hours with superior efficiency. As a result, some workers
(e.g. those with greater motivation, knowledge, skills and abilities) are
more likely to produce vastly superior output compared to others (Van
Iddekinge et al., 2021).
   However, to date, human resource management (HRM) research con-
ducted outside the star literature has not fully accounted for the preva-
lence of increasingly productive stars, providing a potentially inaccurate
picture of HRM’s financial contributions. This is because most HRM
research assumes that individual output is normally-distributed, effectively
denying the presence of stars who create heavy right-tails in individual
output distributions (see Figure 1). Reflecting the central role of the
normality assumption in HRM, consider Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
Despite the widespread use of Pearson’s correlation, significant
non-normality (i.e. created by star performers) must not exist to ensure
accurate correlation values (Bishara & Hittner, 2012; Kowalski, 1972). If
there are major departures from normality, alternative approaches can
be used to derive results that are ‘robust’ (i.e. insensitive) to non-normality.
Yet, so-called robust approaches work by artificially reducing or elimi-
nating the influence of outliers (i.e. stars) and, therefore, still rely on the
normality-based assumption that stars are not much different from
non-stars or that stars do not exist. Given the normality assumption that
partially or completely ignores the presence of stars, there remains the
likely misleading premise that stars largely do not exist and thus HRM’s
financial value may not change by obtaining more stars.
   The utility analysis literature in HRM has also adopted the normality
assumption, largely denying the presence of stars and implying that
HRM’s value does not depend on stars. Utility analysis assesses the
degree to which HRM can contribute to firms financially (Ock & Oswald,
2018; Oprea et al., 2019; Seijts et al., 2020). Illustrating its continued
relevance, HRM researchers refer to utility analysis as an important way
to translate the value of HRM practices into financial terms (e.g. Albrecht
& Marty, 2020; Chapter 14 in Cascio & Aguinis, 2019). Nonetheless,

Figure 1. Normal distribution overlaying a heavily right-tailed distribution. Note. μ = mean
value for each distribution. The normal distribution assumes that most scores cluster around
the mean and fan out into short and symmetrical tails. The heavy-tailed distribution includes
a larger proportion of extreme scores (i.e. star performers) and the majority of scores fall
below the mean.

consistent with the broader HRM literature, utility analysis studies often
explicitly assume that individual output distributions follow normality
(Cascio & Ramos, 1986; Sackett & Yang, 2000; Schmidt et al., 1979) or,
alternatively, state that estimates of HRM’s financial value are essentially
equivalent regardless of departures from normality (Anderson &
Muchinsky, 1991; Burke & Frederick, 1984). In short, the HRM field,
and the utility analysis literature specifically, currently offers the likely
misleading premise that the financial value of HRM does not vary as
a function of obtaining stars.

The present study
Our goal is to examine the financial value that HRM can offer by
obtaining more stars. Given the need to operationalize HRM more
specifically for empirical purposes, we evaluate the HRM practice of
employee selection – that is, how HRM’s financial value may vary from
acquiring more stars. So, although our operationalization choice refers
to employee selection, our results and implications broadly apply to

other HRM domains including training (Carretero-Gómez & Cabrera,
2012), compensation (Sturman et al., 2003) and performance appraisal
and feedback (Landy et al., 1982). A key feature of the utility analysis
procedures we use is that they incorporate the existence of stars by
varying degrees. So, if a utility analysis procedure that more fully incor-
porates the presence of stars produces higher financial valuations than
another procedure which does less of that, the difference indicates
financial gain (i.e. additional financial value generated from HRM obtain-
ing more stars). Thus, we ask:
   Research Question: How does the financial value of HRM vary as a function of
   obtaining more star performers?

    To clarify, we examine value created, not captured, from HRM. As
noted in prior research, some stars may be better equipped than others
for capturing value created (Kehoe et al., 2018). So, our study focuses
on maximum possible value creation from obtaining stars, before the
value is subsequently captured. We also clarify that our study consists
of financial valuations of HRM resulting from more stars, instead of
subjective or psychological evaluations.
    Another aspect of our study is that we use abductive (i.e.
discovery-oriented) reasoning (i.e. studying specific observations to find
a plausible explanation without having to posit hypotheses in advance)
(Behfar & Okhuysen, 2018; Saetre & Van de Ven, 2021), in contrast to
the commonly-used deductive reasoning (i.e. using theory to generate
specific predictions or hypotheses) (Cortina et al., 2017). We adopt
abductive reasoning because, regarding our research question of how
HRM’s value may vary by obtaining more stars, there are largely two
competing theoretical views derived from the star literature (Asgari et
al., 2021): HRM produces less versus greater financial value as a function
of obtaining more stars. In turn, ‘when there is a need to explain
inconsistencies [as is the case in our study], abductive reasoning is
especially useful’ (Behfar & Okhuysen, 2018, p. 328).
    Based on 206 samples of individual performance (i.e. operationalized
as individual output) encompassing 824,924 workers, our results indicated
that HRM adds greater financial value to firms by obtaining more stars.
Specifically, one of the utility analysis procedures we used – the observed
distribution procedure – fully acknowledges the existence of stars by
incorporating actual distributions of individual output to estimate HRM’s
financial value. In contrast, other extant utility analysis procedures we
used assume away the presence of stars by some degree by, for example,
ignoring the top 15% performers (per the global procedure), top 3%
(modified global procedure) or top 1% (further modified procedure). We
found that the observed distribution procedure in general yields higher

financial valuations, up to nine times greater than the other utility anal-
ysis procedures which assume away stars. So, our study quantifies the
extent to which firms benefit financially from obtaining more stars. In
other words, by considering actual distributions of individual performance,
our overall empirical contribution is to demonstrate that HRM resulting
in more stars produces greater financial value than previously believed.
   In addition to our overall empirical contribution, our results provide
several specific theoretical contributions to HRM by helping clarify how,
when and why HRM produces greater financial value as a function of
obtaining more stars. First, given our conclusion that HRM obtaining
stars adds greater value to firms, our evidence further indicates that
increasing focus on obtaining the most productive stars often results in
significant yet diminishing returns. Hence, we offer a nonlinear rather
than a linear understanding of HRM’s financial value, addressing not
only whether but also how HRM generates greater value as a function
of obtaining more stars. Second, we found that the diminishing pattern
is more apparent when output differences among top stars are relatively
small. As a result, we contribute to a better understanding of when
obtaining stars results in more strongly diminishing returns. Third, in
light of our results that diminishing returns are stronger when there
are small output differences among top stars, we elaborate on past
research explaining why such small differences may lead to costs which
diminish the returns from obtaining the most productive stars. We thus
provide an explanation for why obtaining more stars may generate sig-
nificant yet diminishing returns. Next, we elaborate on studies in the
star literature to offer two competing theoretical views addressing how
HRM’s value might vary as a function of obtaining more stars.


Theoretical background
HRM generates less financial value by obtaining more stars
According to one view, HRM generates less value by obtaining more
stars because stars may have a largely harmful impact. Stars can con-
tribute to negative stock-price movements (Groysberg & Lee, 2009),
inhibit non-stars’ learning (Li et al., 2020), reduce group effectiveness
(Overbeck et al., 2005) and produce other costly outcomes (Chen &
Garg, 2018; Kehoe et al., 2018; Prato & Ferraro, 2018). As an illustration,
in biotech firms, some star scientists (e.g. who possess narrow expertise
and are less collaborative) tend to be interested more in protecting their
knowledge rather than expanding it. Such star scientists are potentially
harmful given that they can inhibit non-star scientists from initiating
and leading innovation (Kehoe & Tzabbar, 2015). Even in contexts where
stars are mostly beneficial, relying on stars may make a firm more

vulnerable to disruptions caused by their departure. The negative rela-
tionship between star departure and firm performance, for example,
tends to be stronger among firms that rely on their existing stars so
much to the extent of investing less in HRM (e.g. selection, training)
(Kwon & Rupp, 2013). Star departure may also decrease coworkers’
output quality (Oettl, 2012) and disrupt a firm’s exploitation routines
(Tzabbar & Kehoe, 2014), especially if the stars’ colleagues heavily relied
on the stars’ helping and collaborative behaviors.
   The perspective that HRM generates less value from obtaining more
stars is further bolstered by studies indicating a possible inverted-U
relationship between stars and outcomes (e.g. Call et al., 2020; Groysberg
et al., 2011; Swaab et al., 2014). This research suggests that greater
proportion of stars contributes positively to outcomes such as group
performance or non-stars’ individual performance, though the positive
trend is followed by diminishing and then negative returns. One expla-
nation for an inverted-U pattern is that too many stars can decrease
the quality of coordination among members in a group (Groysberg et
al., 2011). For example, to the degree that stars have large egos that
lead to interpersonal clashes and less collaboration, greater proportions
of stars in a group may aggravate those interpersonal dynamics.
Deterioration in intragroup coordination, in turn, will be more harmful
in reciprocal interdependence contexts (Swaab et al., 2014), where work-
ers (e.g. basketball players) not only complete individual tasks (e.g.
dribbling) but also create intermediate output (e.g. passes) that becomes
the input that other members in the group need to produce final output
(e.g. points scored) (Harder, 1992; Thompson, 1967). Thus, there will
often be an inverted-U relationship between the proportion of stars and
outcomes, suggesting that HRM may yield initially greater but subse-
quently less and then negative financial value from obtaining more stars.


HRM creates greater financial value by obtaining more stars

A competing perspective suggests that HRM resulting in more stars adds
greater value to firms, to the degree that stars have mainly beneficial
effects. Stars can contribute to firm revenue (Han & Ravid, 2020), improve
the odds of firm survival (Bedeian & Armenakis, 1998), facilitate new
product development (Zucker & Darby, 1996), motivate peers to perform
better (Ammann et al., 2016) and achieve other desirable criteria (Bendapudi
& Leone, 2001, Liu, 2014) – which are more likely if stars are supported
by colleagues and firms (Amankwah-Amoah et al., 2017; Groysberg &
Lee, 2008). Thus, stars may add value directly via exceptional output or
indirectly by providing their firms with access to external resources and
exerting significant influence on colleagues (Grigoriou & Rothaermel,


--- PAGE BREAK ---

                   The International Journal of Human Resource Management   4185


2014; Kehoe et al., 2018; O’Boyle & Aguinis, 2012). The greater the num-
ber and variety of ways in which a star contributes to value, the more
sustainable is the star’s value creation for the firm (Kehoe et al., 2018).
The strategic HRM literature suggests that stars’ prolific output is often
due to the valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable (VRIN) nature
of their individual characteristics including knowledge, skills and abilities
(Aguinis & O’Boyle, 2014). The VRIN nature of stars, then, can play a
vital role in creating and maintaining the competitive advantage of firms
in local and international contexts (Minbaeva & Collings, 2013).
   Moreover, past research showing negative returns from greater pro-
portions of stars can be explained by a methodological artifact (Gula
et al., 2021). To detect the presence of negative returns accurately in
correlational studies, it is necessary to use certain regression techniques
(e.g. interrupted-regression) or compare the fit of inverted-U shapes
with that of other nonlinear shapes (e.g. r-shape described by the log-
arithmic growth function) (Hansen, 2000; Marsh & Cormier, 2001,
Simonsohn, 2018; Vaci et al., 2019). Yet, a common way to test for
nonlinear relationships is to estimate a quadratic function by entering
a predictor and a squared term of the predictor. The combination of a
significant positive linear coefficient for the predictor, and a significant
negative coefficient for the squared term, is usually interpreted as evi-
dence of an inverted-U relationship. However, as demonstrated by Gula
et al. (2021), such interpretation is often inappropriate because the
squared term a priori assumes that there are both diminishing and
negative returns, forcing the fitted regression line to bend downwards.
As a result, there may be (very) little or no data points beyond the
estimated inflection point (after which negative returns presumably
occur). To the extent that this artifact explains negative returns found
in the star literature, HRM may produce greater (though still possibly
diminishing) financial returns by obtaining more stars.
   In light of these two competing views, our goal is to better understand
HRM’s financial value as a function of obtaining more stars. We also
sought to clarify possible diminishing or negative returns from HRM
resulting in more star performers, as well as when and why, thereby
integrating existing theoretical perspectives.


Method
Samples
We collected 206 samples of individual output encompassing 824,924
workers, where each case per sample refers to a distinct worker’s output
accumulated within a certain period of time. Given that past research
defined individual performance as behaviors (i.e. actions taken to produce


--- PAGE BREAK ---

4186    H. JOO ET AL.


results), output (i.e. results produced), or a mix of both (Joo et al., 2017),
our use of individual output is consistent with how performance has
been defined in the utility analysis literature for the past 40 years (Chapter
14 in Cascio & Aguinis, 2019; Schmidt et al., 1979; Seijts et al., 2020).
Moreover, our approach is theoretically appropriate for estimating HRM’s
value as a function of obtaining more stars because it considers workers
who manage to accumulate disproportionate amounts of output, even in
the presence of ceiling constraints that prevent many other workers from
producing greater output (Aguinis et al., 2016). So, constraints on indi-
vidual output likely serve as a force that creates a larger gap between
stars’ and non-stars’ output, instead of acting to prevent stars from
emerging. To highlight the representativeness of our samples, we list and
describe the variety of typical occupations from which we collected our
data in Table 1 (e.g. manufacturing, entertainment, high-tech, sports,
banking, research, sales, customer service, agriculture and medicine).
The online supplement provides more details about each of our 206
samples (Appendix A) as well as the source of every sample (Appendix B).
   Per sample, we broadly define stars as workers who produce dis-
proportionately larger amounts of cumulative output compared to their
peers. As illustrated in Figure 1, this broad definition means that stars
exist in heavy right-tails in skewed distributions of individual output.
A star does not have to be the #1 performer in a group, firm or
industry, and we did not limit ourselves to a single cutoff regarding
how much output a worker must produce to be a star. Our broad
definition of stars as those producing disproportionate contributions
is consistent with studies that have similarly adopted a broad stance
rather than specifying a particular cutoff. Almost identical to our
definition, O’Boyle and Kroska (2017) noted that ‘a star exhibits excep-
tionally high quality and/or exceptionally large quantity of output
relative to his or her peers’ (p. 43). Similarly, according to Cappelli
and Keller (2017), ‘a defining characteristic of a star is that he or she
contributes a disproportional amount of output relative to his or her
peers’ (p. 26). In short, our broad conceptualization subsumes more
specific definitions of stars based on varying cutoffs (e.g. top 1% or
3% of performers), allowing us to derive results that are comparable
to previous studies that defined and measured stars using different
cutoffs.


Overview of six procedures for estimating the financial value of HRM

To estimate HRM’s financial value, we used six utility analysis procedures
in each of the 206 samples. Among our six procedures, we first imple-
mented the following four extant procedures based on prior research:

(1) 40% of mean salary, (2) 70% of mean salary, (3) global and (4)
modified global (Burke & Frederick, 1986; Cabrera & Raju, 2001;
Carretero-Gómez & Cabrera, 2012; Hazer & Highhouse, 1997). As our
fifth procedure, the further modified procedure more fully considers
the presence of stars compared to the other four procedures just men-
tioned above. Finally, for our sixth procedure, the observed distribution
procedure most fully incorporates the presence of stars by examining
actual distributions of individual output (while not assuming away any
stars – which the other five procedures do by at least a small amount).

   We implemented all six procedures quantitatively using output-based
performance data rather than qualitatively using subjective assessments
provided by judges, as ‘the overwhelming reliance on subjective esti-
mates’ has limited the impact of past research (Becker & Huselid, 1992,
p. 233). In other words, we conducted financial (not psychological)
valuations of HRM resulting in more stars. Furthermore, each of the
six procedures is based on the Brogden–Cronbach–Gleser (BCG) model
(Brogden, 1949; Cronbach & Gleser, 1965; Sturman, 2000). The BCG
model is the most widely used and influential among prior studies
assessing the financial value of HRM (Cabrera & Raju, 2001). The BCG
model, in the context of acquiring new workers, is described by
Equation (1):

                                             φ
                        ∆µ ($) = N s SDy r     − NC ,
                                             p                       (1)

   where Δμ ($) = financial value of using a valid predictor of worker
performance to systematically acquire new workers; Ns = number of
applicants acquired; SDy = standard deviation of worker performance
in dollars; r = validity coefficient for the focal predictor of worker
performance; p = proportion of applicants acquired (i.e. acquisition
ratio) while assuming top-down acquisition; ϕ = ordinate (i.e. height)
of a normal curve associated with acquisition ratio p; N = number of
applicants and C = average cost for assessing each applicant.


Detailed description of the six procedures for estimating HRM’s financial
value, and their differences

Each of the six procedures not only calculates HRM’s financial value
per sample, but also incorporates the presence of stars in varying degrees
by differing on how the SDy parameter in Equation (1) is calculated.
First, 40% of mean salary most heavily ignores stars because it takes a
small fraction of salary, as opposed to using a wide range of percentiles
on a performance distribution. Second, 70% of mean salary ignores stars
to a lesser degree by taking a larger fraction of salary (i.e. 70% instead
of 40%). Third, the global procedure also ignores stars, but by a lesser
degree compared to the 40% and 70% of mean salary procedures. This
is because the global procedure, rather than simply taking a fraction of
salary, uses a broad range of percentiles on a performance distribution
including up to the 85th percentile in terms of monetary value of worker
performance (while ignoring the top 15% performers). Fourth, the mod-
ified global procedure ignores the presence of stars less heavily than
the global procedure by using a wider range of percentiles, all the way

                  The International Journal of Human Resource Management   4189


up to the 97th percentile (ignoring the top 3%). Fifth, the further mod-
ified procedure considers an even wider range of percentiles by including
up to the 99th percentile (ignoring just the top 1%), thus incorporating
stars more heavily compared to the modified global procedure. Sixth,
the observed distribution procedure most fully considers stars (i.e. does
not ignore any stars that exist) because the procedure calculates the
standard deviation across all cases in the performance distribution. Table
2 provides the calculations involved in the implementation of each of
the six procedures.
   Full implementation of the six procedures requires not just calculation
of the SDy parameter, but also information on the parameters on the
right-hand side of Equation (1). For each right-hand side parameter, we
used a range of values to ensure generalizable results. Table 3 shows
the values used for each right-hand side parameter and explains their
rationale. Based on these values, we created nine distinct combinations
of parameter values that we used to implement each of the six
procedures.1


Calculation of financial gain from obtaining more stars

After using each of the six procedures to estimate HRM’s financial value
in each sample, we also assessed HRM’s financial value as a function
of obtaining more stars. We derived financial gain per sample by com-
paring the following set of estimated financial values: (1) financial value
of HRM estimated from the observed distribution procedure (which
incorporates the existence of stars fully) versus (2) financial value of
HRM estimated from each of the five other procedures (which assume
away the presence of stars by at least a small amount). As a result, we
calculated five financial gains per sample. These five financial gains
allowed us to quantify the extent to which the procedure that fully
incorporates stars (i.e. observed distribution procedure) results in greater
financial valuations compared to the other five procedures that ignore
stars by varying degrees. This way, financial gain indicates the extent
to which HRM, by obtaining more stars, offers greater financial value,
and how much.
   Each financial gain is expressed in terms of multiples (i.e. how many
times the financial value estimated from the observed distribution pro-
cedure is greater or smaller than the financial value estimated from
another procedure assuming away stars). So, a positive multiple greater
than 1 means that the financial value estimated using the observed dis-
tribution procedure (fully considering stars) is greater than the financial
value estimated using another procedure (ignoring stars by a certain
degree); that is, HRM obtaining more stars added to financial value. A

Table 2. Description of six procedures used for estimating the financial value of HRM.
1. 40% of mean salary
   We obtained mean salary (as of 2016) for the focal occupation by first consulting bls.gov (the Bureau
   of Labor Statistics’ website). If the mean salary for the occupation was not available from bls.gov, we
   used the median salary (as of 2016). If neither the mean nor the median salary was available from bls.
   gov, we obtained the mean or median salary (as of 2016) for the focal occupation from other websites
   (e.g. forbes.com). Next, we used the equation below:
   0.40 * mean salary = SDy (i.e. standard deviation of worker performance in dollars) based on 40% of mean salary
2. 70% of mean salary
   We obtained mean salary (as of 2016) for the focal occupation by first consulting bls.gov. If needed, we
   instead obtained the median salary (as of 2016) from bls.gov or the mean/median salary (as of 2016) from
   other websites (e.g. forbes.com). Next, we used the equation below:
   0.70 * mean salary = SDy (i.e. standard deviation of worker performance in dollars) based on 70% of mean salary
3. Global procedure
   We first calculated the difference between the 85th percentile and 50th; difference between the 50th and
   15th; and difference between the 15th and minimum (where each percentile refers to a monetary value of
   worker performance). We then took the average of the three percentile differences. The resulting value
   was standard deviation in terms of worker output, or SDo, as shown in the equation below:
   {(85th percentile − 50th) + (50th − 15th) + (15th − minimum)}/3 = SDo
   Next, to convert the SDo value into monetary terms, we borrowed from prior research suggesting that the
   ratio of SDy (i.e. standard deviation of worker performance in dollars) based on the global procedure to
   SDy based on the 40% of mean salary procedure is about 2.75, or 35,192 divided by 12,789 (Burke &
   Frederick, 1986). So, we multiplied 2.75 with SDy calculated using the 40% of mean salary procedure. The
   resulting value was SDy based on the global procedure, as shown in the equation below:
   2.75 × (0.40 × mean salary) = SDy based on the global procedure
4. Modified global procedure
   We first calculated the difference between the 97th percentile and 85th; difference between the 85th and
   50th; difference between the 50th and 15th; and difference between the 15th and minimum (where each
   percentile refers to a monetary value of worker performance). We then took the average of the four
   percentile differences. The resulting value was standard deviation in terms of worker output, or SDo, as
   shown below:
   {(97th percentile − 85th) + (85th − 50th) + (50th − 15th) + (15th − minimum)}/4 = SDo
   Next, to convert the SDo value into monetary terms, we calculated the ratio of SDo based on the modified
   global procedure to SDo based on the global procedure. Then, we multiplied the resulting ratio with SDy
   (i.e. standard deviation of worker performance in dollars) based on the global procedure. The resulting
   value was SDy based on the modified global procedure, as shown in the equation below:
   (SDo based on modified global / SDo based on global) × SDy based on global = SDy based on the
   modified global procedure
5. Further modified procedure
    We added the difference between the 99th percentile and 97th, to the four percentile differences considered
    by the modified global procedure. We then took the average of the five percentile differences. The resulting
    value was standard deviation in terms of worker output, or SDo, as shown in the equation below:
    {(99th percentile − 97th) + (97th − 85th) + (85th − 50th) + (50th − 15th) + (15th − minimum)}/5 = SDo
    Next, to convert the SDo value into monetary terms, we calculated the ratio of SDo based on the further
    modified procedure to SDo based on the modified global procedure. Then, we multiplied the resulting
    ratio with SDy (i.e. standard deviation of worker performance in dollars) based on the modified global
    procedure. The resulting value was SDy based on the further modified procedure, as shown in the
    equation below:
    (SDo based on further modified/SDo based on modified global) × SDy based on modified global = SDy
    based on the further modified procedure
6. Observed distribution procedure
    We first calculated the standard deviation across all cases of worker output (i.e. SDo based on the
    observed distribution procedure). Next, to convert the SDo value into monetary terms, we calculated the
    ratio of SDo based on the observed distribution procedure to SDo based on the global procedure. We then
    multiplied the resulting ratio with the SDy (i.e. standard deviation of worker performance in dollars) based
    on the global procedure. The resulting value was SDy based on the observed distribution procedure, as
    shown in the equation below:
    (SDo based on observed distribution procedure/SDo based on global) × SDy based on global = SDy based
    on observed distribution procedure
Note. We incorporated the presence of the lowest performers (i.e. difference between the 15th percentile and
  minimum) across the global, modified global and further modified procedures (i.e. procedures #3–5). By con-
  sidering the same range of lowest performers across these procedures, we were able to accurately isolate
  HRM’s estimated value as a function of obtaining more stars, operationalized as workers who are above certain
  high percentiles (e.g. 99th percentile, or the top 1%). The presence of the lowest performers is already incor-
  porated in the observed distribution procedure because it calculates the standard deviation among all cases
  of worker output.

C = average cost for            C = $75.26, $752.63 and $1505.25. The three values were obtained and
   assessing each                   adapted from Hoffman and Thornton (1997), where the authors used
   applicant                        $50, $500, or $1000 for C. The $50 value was used for the cost of
                                    administering an aptitude test per applicant. The $500 and $1000 values
                                    were used as low and high estimates for the cost of using an
                                    assessment center per applicant. To update the three values from 1997
                                    to 2016 dollars, we averaged the results from three websites:
                                    dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php; usinflationcalculator.com; and
                                    calculator.net/inflation-calculator.html. The updated values were $75.26,
                                    $752.63 and $1505.25.
p = proportion of               p = 0.50, 0.32 and 0.15. As shown in Appendix A of Boudreau (1991), the
   applicants acquired              three ratios closely match some of the most commonly adopted
   (i.e. acquisition ratio)         acquisition ratios in prior studies. The acquisition ratio of 0.50 has been
   while assuming                   used for food and beverage sales managers (Cascio & Silbey, 1979), U.S.
   top-down acquisition             government computer programmers (Schmidt et al., 1979) and power
                                    plant operators (Dunnette et al., 1982). The acquisition ratio of about
                                    0.32 has been used for nursing assistants (Schmidt & Hoffmann, 1973),
                                    convenience store managers (Weekley et al., 1985), telephone company
                                    office managers (Cascio & Ramos, 1986) and clerical employees
                                    (Cronshaw et al., 1987). The acquisition ratio of 0.15 has been used for
                                    welders, mechanics, technicians and machine operators (Wroten, 1984).
ϕ = ordinate (i.e. height)      ϕ = 0.3989, 0.3572 and 0.2323. The three values correspond to our use of
   of a normal curve                0.50, 0.32 and 0.15 for acquisition ratio p, respectively. To identify the
   associated with                  ordinate associated with a specific acquisition ratio, we used the
   acquisition ratio p              Naylor–Shine table (Naylor & Shine, 1965), which we accessed from
                                    Appendix B in Cascio and Boudreau (2011).
N = number of applicants        N = 100, 20 and 7. N = 100 was based on Cascio and Silbey (1979),
                                    representing large-scale applicant pools that characterize many
                                    acquisition situations. But because many other acquisition situations
                                    involve small applicant pools, such as fewer than 20 applicants or even
                                    fewer than 10 applicants (Scullen & Meyer, 2014), we also used the
                                    values of 20 and 7 for N.
Ns = number of                  Ns = 50, 32, 15, 3 and 1. These values follow from the pair of acquisition
   applicants acquired              ratio p and applicant pool size N used. For example, if the acquisition
                                    ratio p is 0.15 and the applicant pool size N is 100, then Ns must be 15.

  their rationale is described in the text.



negative multiple lower than −1 means that the financial value estimated
from the observed distribution procedure is less than that estimated from
another procedure; in other words, obtaining more stars diminished value.
   Next, per comparison between the observed distribution procedure
and each other procedure, we averaged the financial gains calculated
across our samples. For example, a multiple of 2 means that the observed
distribution procedure led to a financial value that is twice the size of
the financial value from another procedure which ignores stars by a
certain amount. In contrast, a multiple of −2 means that the observed
distribution procedure led to a financial value that is half the size of

the two multiples is zero, indicating that obtaining more stars overall
neither added to nor diminished value. Table 4 includes additional details
on how we calculated financial gain from obtaining more stars.

Table 4. Procedures for calculating financial gain from HRM obtaining more stars, expressed
in terms of multiples.
Overview: We calculated financial gain in terms of multiples by comparing two financial values against
each other: (1) the financial value of HRM derived from the observed distribution procedure that fully
considers stars versus (2) the financial value of HRM derived from each of the five procedures ignoring
stars by varying degrees (i.e. 40% of mean salary, 70% of mean salary, global, modified global, or further
modified). Because the observed distribution procedure is compared to each of the five other procedures,
a total of five comparisons were conducted. Per comparison, we used one of the formulas below
depending on the result derived from using the procedure ignoring stars by a certain amount, as
explained below.
Condition #1:                                         Formula for condition #1:
   If the observed distribution procedure produced       = Financial value derived from the observed
   a larger positive financial value than the            distribution procedure/Financial value derived
   positive financial value from the procedure           from the procedure ignoring stars
   ignoring stars, we used the formula shown on
   the right-hand side to calculate financial gain in
   terms of multiples:
Condition #2:                                         Formula for condition #2:
   If the observed distribution procedure produced       = (Financial value derived from using the
   a smaller positive financial value than the           procedure ignoring stars/Financial value derived
   positive financial value from the procedure           from the observed distribution procedure) × −1
   ignoring stars, we used the formula shown on
   the right-hand side to calculate financial gain in
   terms of multiples:
Condition #3:                                         Formula for condition #3:
   If the observed distribution procedure produced       = (Financial value derived from using the
   a smaller negative financial value than the           procedure ignoring stars/Financial value derived
   negative financial value from the procedure           from the observed distribution procedure)
   ignoring stars, we used the formula shown on
   the right-hand side to calculate financial gain in
   terms of multiples:
Condition #4:                                         Formula for condition #4:
   If the observed distribution procedure produced       = [(Financial value derived from the observed
   a negative financial value, whereas the               distribution procedure × −1) + Financial value
   procedure ignoring stars produced a positive          derived from using the procedure ignoring
   financial value, we used the formula shown on         stars]/Financial value derived from the observed
   the right-hand side to calculate financial gain in    distribution procedure
   terms of multiples:
Condition #5:                                         Formula for condition #5:
   If the observed distribution procedure produced       = [(Financial value derived from the procedure
   a positive financial value, whereas the               ignoring stars × −1) + Financial value derived
   procedure ignoring stars produced a negative          from the observed distribution procedure]/
   financial value, we used the formula shown on         (Financial value derived from the procedure
   the right-hand side to calculate financial gain in    ignoring stars × −1)
   terms of multiples:
The above calculations allowed us to derive a multiple per sample per comparison. Then, for each
   comparison, we averaged the multiples across numerous samples (e.g. all 206 of our samples), thus
   producing financial gain in terms of multiples.

Note. k = number of samples. Each numeric score quantifies the financial gain from obtaining more stars.
  Financial gain is expressed in terms of multiples (i.e. how many times the financial value estimated from
  the observed distribution procedure is greater or smaller than the financial value estimated from another
  procedure assuming away stars). A positive multiple greater than 1 means that the financial value estimated
  using the observed distribution procedure (fully considering stars) is greater than the financial value
  estimated using another procedure (ignoring stars by a certain degree); that is, HRM obtaining more stars
  added to financial value. A negative multiple lower than −1 means that the financial value estimated from
  the observed distribution procedure is less than that estimated from another procedure; in other words,
  HRM obtaining more stars diminished value. The three excluded samples from the ‘All samples except
  outliers’ row are samples #114 and 190–191, as listed in Appendix A in the Online Supplement; the three

extremely influential outliers (i.e. samples #114 and 190–191, as listed
in Appendix A in the Online Supplement). Figure 2 includes box plots
associated with estimates of financial gains in Table 5. Table 5 and
Figure 2 show that estimates of financial gain were larger when the
financial valuation from the observed distribution procedure (fully con-
sidering the presence of stars) was compared to financial valuations
from extant procedures that more heavily assume away stars. That is,
stars are most heavily ignored by 40% of mean salary, followed 70% of
mean salary, which more heavily ignores stars than the global procedure,
which does so more than the modified global procedure, followed by
the further modified procedure. Given such, estimated financial gain
was 9.08, 4.94, 2.76, 1.25 or 0.54 – when comparing the observed dis-
tribution procedure to the 40% of mean salary, 70% of mean salary,
global, modified global or further modified procedure, respectively (after
excluding the outlier samples). Thus, the answer to our Research
Question is that HRM adds greater financial value by obtaining
more stars.2

Results based on different groups of samples

To assess the generalizability of our overall empirical conclusion, we
conducted more specific analyses based on different groups of samples.
Next, we report estimates of financial gain across a wide variety of
occupations, performance measures, team versus individual sports,
actual output versus forced rankings and one-star-only versus
multiple-stars sports.

Figure 2. Box plots illustrating financial gains from HRM obtaining more stars. Note. Financial
gain is expressed in terms of multiples (i.e. how many times the financial value estimated
from the observed distribution procedure is greater or smaller than the financial value
estimated from another procedure assuming away stars). A positive multiple greater than
1 means that the financial value estimated using the observed distribution procedure (fully
considering stars) is greater than the financial value estimated using another procedure
(ignoring stars by a certain degree); that is, HRM obtaining more stars added to financial
value. A negative multiple lower than −1 means that the financial value estimated from
the observed distribution procedure is less than that estimated from another procedure; in
other words, HRM obtaining more stars diminished value. We denote mean financial gains
by using an asterisk (*); these mean values match the second row of results in Table 5.
The median value is shown by the line dividing each box into two parts (with different
colors). The ends of the box are the 25th and 75th quartiles. The top whiskers indicate the
95th percentile value and the bottom whiskers indicate the 5th percentile value. We cal-
culated each box plot based on 203 samples (i.e. all our samples, except outlier samples
#114 and 190–191 listed in Appendix A in the Online Supplement). These three outlier
samples were not incorporated in the box plots due to their extreme influence.


Different occupations and performance measures
Tables 6 and 7 report estimates of financial gain across different occupations
and performance measures, respectively. Across occupations and perfor-
mance measures, HRM generally created greater financial value by obtaining
more stars. So, our overall empirical conclusion remained unchanged.

Team versus individual sports
Appendix D in the Online Supplement shows estimates of financial gain
based on samples indicating team (e.g. baseball, basketball) versus indi-
vidual sports (e.g. bowling, tennis). We again found that HRM adds
greater value as a function of obtaining more stars, regardless of team
versus individual sports.

  represented in this table combined = 824,924.



Actual output versus forced rankings
Table 8 provides estimates of financial gain based on samples indicating
actual output (e.g. meters of rice planted, lines of code per hour, revenue
generated) versus forced rankings (e.g. expert rankings for Edgar Allan
Poe Awards, Olympic medals). Regardless of actual output versus forced
rankings, results supported our overall empirical conclusion that HRM
adds greater value by obtaining more stars.

One-star-only versus multiple-stars sports
Some sports represented in our samples are one-star-only sports in
that multiple players usually cannot be stars simultaneously. Appendix
E in the Online Supplement shows estimates of financial gain based
on samples indicating one-star-only (e.g. tennis, alpine skiers) versus
multiple-stars sports (e.g. baseball, hockey). Regardless of one-star-
only or multiple-stars sports, results again supported the overall
empirical conclusion that HRM can add greater value by obtaining
more stars.

Results indicating significant yet diminishing returns from HRM obtaining
more stars

Beyond our overall empirical conclusion that HRM can add greater
financial value as a function of obtaining more stars, Tables 5–8 in the
manuscript and Appendices D and E in the Online Supplement also
indicate that HRM often produces significant yet diminishing returns
by increasingly focusing on obtaining the most productive stars.

Specifically, to estimate the financial gain from obtaining more stars,
we compared the financial valuation from the observed distribution
procedure (which does not assume away any stars) to the financial
valuation from each of the other procedures (assuming away stars by
varying degrees). Because the 40% of mean salary procedure assumes
away stars by the greatest amount, financial gain estimated from com-
paring the observed distribution procedure to 40% of mean salary was
generally the largest (e.g. 9.08 in Table 5, without outlier samples). In
turn, given the 70% of mean salary procedure that assumes away stars
by a lesser degree, estimated financial gain from comparing the observed
distribution procedure to 70% of mean salary was generally the second
largest (e.g. 4.94 in Table 5, without outlier samples). The global and
modified global procedures assume away stars by increasingly smaller
amounts (i.e. ignoring the top 15% or 3% of all performers in a sample,
respectively). Accordingly, estimated financial gain from comparing the
observed distribution procedure to the global and modified global pro-
cedures were usually the third and fourth largest (e.g. 2.76 and 1.25 in
Table 5, excluding outlier samples). Finally, the further modified pro-
cedure assumes away stars by an even smaller degree by ignoring just
the top 1%, so that financial gain estimated from comparing the observed
distribution procedure to the further modified procedure was typically
the smallest (e.g. 0.54 in Table 5, without outlier samples).
   In particular, financial gains estimated from comparing the observed
distribution procedure to the further modified procedure were usually
close to or between −1 and 1, indicating that HRM overall neither
added to nor diminished value by obtaining the top 1%. Even the
financial gains estimated from comparing the observed distribution
procedure to the modified global procedure were often close to values
between −1 and 1 or just slightly higher than 1. This means that HRM
generally added, at best, a relatively small amount of financial value by
more broadly obtaining the top 3% (e.g. estimated financial gain of 1.25
in Table 5 indicates that obtaining stars including the top 3% was on
average about 25% more financially valuable than obtaining stars except
the top 3%). These findings show that HRM often produces significant
yet diminishing returns by increasingly focusing on obtaining the most
productive stars.


Results indicating when diminishing returns are stronger or weaker

At the same time, our results indicate that the diminishing pattern is
not always very apparent. As shown in Tables 6 and 7, sometimes
financial gains estimated from comparing the observed distribution
procedure to the further modified procedure were significantly or at

least incrementally higher than 1 (e.g. among researchers or program-
mers in Table 6, as well as among other research output and income
from grants/awards in Table 7). In such instances, the diminishing
pattern was weaker. To better understand when obtaining stars results
in stronger or weaker diminishing returns (i.e. when increasingly focus-
ing on obtaining the most productive stars overall adds little/no addi-
tional value or adds possibly slightly greater value), we conducted several
follow-up analyses shown below.


Longer versus shorter time frames
Table 9 reports financial gains by longer versus shorter time frames for
allowing more versus fewer stars to emerge, respectively. As noted by
Joo et al. (2017), a relatively long time period is needed for some
workers in a group to achieve star-level output. Financial gains were
larger in samples indicating longer time frames, and smaller in samples
indicating shorter time frames. In particular, financial gains estimated
from comparing the observed distribution procedure to the modified
global and further modified procedures were larger among samples with
longer time frames, yet smaller among short time frame samples (i.e.

1.54 and 0.85 versus 0.61 and 0.48, respectively). Thus, the diminishing
pattern is weaker when the time frame is longer.

Higher versus lower performance ceilings
Table 10 shows financial gains by higher versus lower performance
ceilings for allowing more versus fewer stars to emerge, respectively. As
noted by Aguinis et al. (2016), more stars tend to emerge in contexts
with higher ceilings. Financial gains were larger among higher ceiling
samples with or without outlier samples, and smaller among lower ceiling
samples. In particular, financial gains estimated from comparing the
observed distribution procedure to the modified global and further
modified procedures were larger among samples characterized by higher
ceilings (without outlier samples), but smaller among lower ceiling sam-
ples (i.e. 1.42 and 0.56 versus 0.16 and 0.38, respectively). So, the dimin-
ishing pattern is weaker when the ceiling is higher.

Higher versus lower control over individual output
Table 11 reports financial gains based on higher versus lower control
by workers over their own individual output. We broadly defined
higher-control occupations as ‘typical’ occupations (e.g. sales, laborers,
managers), and lower-control occupations as ‘special’ occupations (e.g.
sports, entertainment). This is because in special occupations, environ-
mental factors and luck (e.g. actions of competing players, getting noticed
by a movie director in a chance event) likely play a stronger role while
individual actions play a weaker role (e.g. Macnamara et al., 2016).

  typical occupations included in this table are bank tellers, retail sales associates, call center employees,
  fundraising callers, paper sorters, pelt pullers, toll-ticket sorters, typists, operators, sewers, electrical fixture
  assemblers, lawyers, managers, agricultural workers, managers, transcribers, produce packers, recruiters,
  financial advisors, doctors, laundry workers and programmers (see Table 1 for more details).


Although a possible disadvantage of using individual output data is that
workers often do not have much control over their output, our samples
vary in terms of workers’ degree of control over their individual output.
Financial gains were smaller among higher control samples (without
outlier samples), and larger among lower control samples (without outlier
samples). In particular, financial gains estimated from comparing the
observed distribution procedure to the modified global and further
modified procedures were smaller among samples characterized by higher
control (without outlier samples), but larger among lower control samples
(i.e. 0.58 and 0.44 versus 1.43 and 0.56, respectively). These findings
show that the diminishing pattern is stronger when workers have higher
control over their output.

Different distribution shapes
Table 12 reports financial gains based on two groups of distribution
shapes: (1) exponential-tail (characterized by right-tails that rapidly
decay, or fall off, at the very end) versus (2) lognormal or pure power
law (whose right-tails do not decay as rapidly as the exponential-tail)
(Aguinis et al., 2018; Joo et al., 2017). In other words, output differences
among stars at the top will tend to be smaller among exponential-tail
samples, and larger among lognormal or pure power law samples. We
thus expected a stronger diminishing pattern among exponential-tail

samples. Consistent with our expectation, financial gains were smaller
among exponential-tail samples (without outlier samples), and larger
among lognormal or pure power law samples. In particular, financial
gains estimated from comparing the observed distribution procedure to
the modified global and further modified procedures were smaller among
samples characterized by exponential-tails (without outlier samples)
rather than lognormal or pure power law (i.e. 1.23 and 0.45 versus 1.74
and 0.93, respectively).3 Moreover, Table 13 shows that a large minority
of the researchers samples best-fit the lognormal or pure power law,
whereas the exponential-tail was the more clearly best-fitting shape
among the entertainers except outliers, athletes/coaches and salespeople
samples. Financial gains estimated from comparing the observed distri-
bution procedure to the modified global and further modified procedures
were larger among the researchers samples, but smaller among the other
three sample groups (1.87 and 1.11 versus 1.29, 1.03, or 0.94 and 0.05,
0.45, or 0.59). In short, the diminishing pattern is stronger if the under-
lying distribution best fits the exponential-tail, and weaker if the
best-fitting shape is the lognormal or pure power law.

Discussion
The observed distribution procedure (which does not assume away
any stars) generally produced higher financial valuations than other
extant utility analysis procedures (which assume away stars). Stated
differently, we demonstrated empirically that previous methods of
assessing financial value underestimated the value brought by obtaining
more stars, indicating how much greater value HRM can add by

Note. For the purpose of comparing occupations that heavily follow the exponential-tail shape versus those
  that heavily follow the lognormal or pure power law, occupations under ‘Not Considered’ were excluded
  because they included outlier samples (in the case of Entertainers, k = 55); the majority of samples best-fit
  distribution shapes other than the exponential-tail, lognormal, or pure power law (in the case of Laborers,
  k = 17); or the number of samples in the occupation was likely too small to conduct a meaningful comparison
  (i.e. k < 10). Financial gain is expressed in terms of multiples (i.e. how many times the financial value esti-
  mated from the observed distribution procedure is greater or smaller than the financial value estimated
  from another procedure assuming away stars). A positive multiple greater than 1 means that the financial
  value estimated using the observed distribution procedure (fully considering stars) is greater than the
  financial value estimated using another procedure (ignoring stars by a certain degree); that is, HRM obtaining
  more stars added to financial value. A negative multiple lower than −1 means that the financial value
  estimated from the observed distribution procedure is less than that estimated from another procedure; in
  other words, HRM obtaining more stars diminished value. The excluded samples in some of the rows are
  samples #114 and 190–191, as listed in Appendix A in the Online Supplement; these three samples are
  outliers due to their extreme influence. Total N (i.e. number of workers) for all samples represented in this

 helping firms obtain more star performers. We also found that HRM
 often generates significant yet diminishing returns by increasingly
 focusing on obtaining the most productive stars. Financial gains esti-
 mated from comparing the observed distribution procedure to the
 further modified procedure, in particular, indicated that HRM overall
 neither added to nor diminished value by obtaining the top 1% of all
 performers in a sample. Our results offer several theoretical contribu-
 tions to HRM, as described below.

Theoretical implications for HRM

We contribute to HRM theory by helping clarify whether, how, when
and why HRM produces greater financial value as a function of obtaining
more stars. First, regarding not just whether but also how HRM gen-
erates greater value by obtaining more stars, our results offer a nonlinear
rather than a linear understanding of HRM’s value. Given our overall
empirical finding that obtaining more stars can add greater value to
firms, our evidence further indicated that increasingly focusing on
obtaining the most productive stars often generates diminishing returns.
On one hand, we found that obtaining more stars can contribute as
much as nine times greater financial value, reflecting the maximum
extent to which obtaining stars may benefit firms (see the row ‘all
samples except outliers’ in Table 5). These findings were replicated in
a variety of occupations and performance measures, as summarized in
Tables 6 and 7. At the same time, our results showed that obtaining
more stars can often produce diminishing returns, as indicated by the
rapidly decreasing gains that can be seen going from the left-hand col-
umns to the right in Tables 6 and 7. Stated differently, Tables 6 and 7
showed that by obtaining more and more productive stars (e.g. the top
1% rather than more broadly the top 3%), HRM creates additional
financial value that often becomes increasingly smaller, close to zero.
We thus contribute to a nonlinear model of the value of HRM, which
generates significant yet diminishing returns by increasingly focusing
on obtaining the most productive stars.
   Second, we contribute to a better understanding of when obtaining
stars results in stronger or weaker diminishing returns. Results showed
that the diminishing pattern is stronger when output differences among
top stars are relatively small. For example, Table 9 organizes results
based on longer versus shorter time frames, where the latter creates
smaller output differences among top stars by imposing a lower ceiling
constraint on how much output top stars can accumulate. Among sam-
ples with shorter time frames (and thus smaller output differences among
top stars), the diminishing pattern was stronger. Similarly, Table 10
reports results based on higher versus lower performance ceilings, where
the latter creates smaller output differences among top stars. The dimin-
ishing pattern was more heightened among samples with lower ceilings
(and thus smaller output differences among top stars).
   Results in Tables 11–13 offered further support for small output
differences among top stars as a key context strengthening or dimin-
ishing returns from obtaining more stars. Table 11 shows results based
on typical (characterized by higher control over output) versus special
occupations (lower control). Workers who have a higher degree of

control over their own output are generally more likely to attain
star-level output, so that output differences among top stars are smaller
– a context which facilitates stronger diminishing returns. As shown
in Table 11, the diminishing pattern was indeed stronger among ‘typ-
ical’ occupations such as sales, laborers and managers where workers
have higher control over output. Meanwhile, diminishing returns were
weaker among ‘special’ occupations such as sports and entertainment,
characterized by lower control. Table 12 indicates that the diminishing
pattern was more apparent among samples that best-fit the
exponential-tail shape, where top stars have increasingly smaller output
differences. In contrast, the diminishing pattern in Table 12 was weaker
among samples that best-fit other non-normal shapes (i.e. pure power
law, lognormal), where top stars have increasingly larger (not smaller)
output differences. Similarly, Table 13 shows that the diminishing
pattern was stronger in occupations that heavily fit shapes with increas-
ingly smaller output differences at the top, but weaker among occu-
pations that heavily fit distribution shapes with increasingly larger
output differences among top stars. Thus, as our second contribution
to HRM theory, we clarify that diminishing returns from HRM are
stronger when output differences among top stars are small.
   Third, our study also provides a theoretical explanation for why
obtaining stars can produce significant yet diminishing returns. Going
beyond our finding that diminishing returns are more likely when there
are small output differences among top stars, we further theorize that
those small differences better enable various costs to manifest – to the
effect of diminishing the returns from obtaining the most productive
stars who are just slightly more productive than other top stars. The
star literature offers several examples of such costs (i.e. created by small
output differences among top stars). For instance, relatively small output
differences among top stars (i.e. ‘excessive similarity’) create ambiguity
in the status hierarchy, which those stars seek to clarify by competing
with each other more intensely and perhaps in a disruptive manner
(Groysberg et al., 2011, p. 725). As another example, when output
differences among stars are small, the same psychological tendency
would be considered biases that lead to overvaluing top stars (Massey
& Thaler, 2013). As yet another example, if there are numerous and
similarly productive top stars serving as many role models, top stars
can (inadvertently) signal inconsistent sets of behavioral cues that inhibit
non-stars’ learning, especially since ‘exemplary performance can be
demonstrated in many different ways’ (Call et al., 2020, p. 6). In short,
we contribute to a better understanding of not only how and when,
but also why obtaining stars often produce significant yet diminishing
returns.

Contributions to the star literature

Our explanation of the nonlinear pattern also contributes back to the
star literature from which we borrowed theoretical rationale. To explain
why obtaining stars may often produce significant but diminishing
returns, we had stated that relatively small output differences among
top stars may create various costs which diminish the returns from
obtaining the most productive stars. This explanation then helps integrate
specific explanations for stars’ curvilinear influence proposed in past
research, thereby improving theoretical parsimony.
   Specifically, to the effect of reducing theoretical parsimony, studies
in the star literature have offered numerous and disparate explanations
for stars’ often curvilinear impact, such as disruptions caused by com-
petition among stars to establish a clear status hierarchy (Groysberg et
al., 2011); biases that lead managers to over-value top stars (Massey &
Thaler, 2013); and stars’ behaviors that reduce the learning of non-stars
(un)intentionally (Call et al., 2020). Given such, small output differences
among top stars may facilitate or allow these mechanisms to occur in
the first place. If stars have large differences in output, a clear status
hierarchy would exist and prevent disruptive competition between stars
who seek to establish a clear hierarchy (Groysberg et al., 2011); if top
stars have large enough differences in output, managers’ tendency to
disproportionately value the contributions of top stars may be justified
(Massey & Thaler, 2013); and large output differences among top stars
likely mean that there are just one or few of those stars who serve as
clear role models for non-stars, reducing inconsistent cues from stars
about how to work (Call et al., 2020). Thus, our emphasis on small
output differences among top stars serves as a broad theoretical com-
ponent that is common across and, therefore, links together the many
specific explanations for stars’ curvilinear impact.


Implications for HRM practice

Our results highlight the need to use utility analysis procedures that
more fully consider the presence of stars. The financial value estimated
from the observed distribution procedure (which fully considers stars)
was on average up to nine times greater than the value estimated from
other extant procedures (which ignore stars by varying degrees). In
other words, extant procedures often significantly underestimated the
value brought by obtaining more stars. It thus follows that firms should
ideally use the observed distribution procedure, which estimated HRM’s
value most accurately by incorporating reality as is rather than ignoring
stars who exist. By considering stars more fully, financial valuations of

HRM based on the observed distribution procedure are not only more
accurate, but also more comparable with valuations of other business
areas (e.g. marketing) that recognize the reality that often few products
and services contribute disproportionately to a firm’s bottom line
(Mariotti, 2008).
    Yet, full data on performance distributions needed to implement the
observed distribution procedure are often unavailable. So, it may be nec-
essary to use other procedures that do not require full data. Among the
five procedures ignoring stars by at least some degree, we suggest using
the further modified procedure because it led to the most consistently
accurate results (i.e. estimated financial values closest to those derived from
the observed distribution procedure). The superior accuracy of the further
modified procedure is evidenced by the fact that financial gains in Tables
5–13 (and in Appendices D and E in the Online Supplement) were smallest
(i.e. closest to values between 1 and −1), when the observed distribution
procedure was compared to the further modified procedure. The further
modified procedure enjoys superior accuracy by assuming away stars by
the least amount (i.e. by ignoring just the top 1%), compared to the other
four procedures that assume away stars by a larger degree (e.g. the top 3%
ignored). This way, our results help address demands from top management
to financially justify HRM practices.


Limitations and future research directions

First, when implementing utility analysis procedures, we did not incor-
porate all possible costs of obtaining stars because we examined value
created from HRM, not captured. So, used in isolation, each of the
utility analysis procedures in our study likely leads to valuations that
are too high (Whyte & Latham, 1997). To examine net value after at
least some of the initial value created has been captured and otherwise
deducted, practical implementation of utility analysis should add
cost-related parameters in Equation (1) by including additional costs
such as opportunity costs, taxes and compensation (Boudreau, 1983;
Cabrera & Raju, 2001; Sturman, 2000). Indeed, regarding compensation,
some stars may be better equipped than others for capturing value
created (Kehoe et al., 2018).
   Second, our results may not generalize to contexts where performance
is defined and operationalized as behaviors. The reason is that behavioral
performance may follow more normally-distributed shapes than heavily
right-tailed distributions (Beck et al., 2014). But when performance is
defined and operationalized in terms of output as done in our study,
performance is likely to follow non-normally-distributed curves charac-
terized by heavy right-tails containing stars (Aguinis et al., 2018). It is

                    The International Journal of Human Resource Management        4207


possible that our results only apply to contexts where worker perfor-
mance is defined and operationalized as output. Thus, future research
can examine the extent to which our findings also apply to behavior-
rather than output-based performance.

Concluding remarks
Our overall empirical finding was that HRM creates greater financial
value by obtaining more stars. We also offered several theoretical con-
tributions to HRM and the star literature. First, our results offered a
nonlinear model of HRM’s value, where HRM produces significant yet
diminishing returns by increasingly focusing on obtaining the most
productive stars. Second, regarding when, we provided evidence that
diminishing returns from HRM are stronger when output differences
among top stars are relatively small. Third, regarding why, we explained
that small output differences among top stars may create various costs
which diminish the returns from obtaining the most productive stars.
Fourth, our explanation of HRM’s nonlinear pattern also contributed to
the star literature by helping integrate a number of specific explanations
for stars’ curvilinear influence proposed in past research. From a prac-
tical view, we highlighted the need to use utility analysis procedures
that more fully consider the presence of stars because extant procedures
often significantly underestimate the value brought by obtaining more
stars. By considering stars more fully, valuations of HRM are more
accurate and also comparable with valuations of other business areas
that recognize the reality that often few products and services contribute
disproportionately to a firm’s bottom line. In closing, we hope our article
will stimulate HRM research and applications that fully consider the
prevalence of stars and their relative value to firms.


Notes
1.   The nine distinct combinations of parameter values are as follows. (1): Ns = 50,
     r = 0.3, ϕ = 0.3989, p = 0.5, N = 100, C = $75.26; (2): Ns = 50, r = 0.4,
     ϕ = 0.3989, p = 0.5, N = 100, C = $75.26; (3): Ns = 50, r = 0.5, ϕ = 0.3989,
     p = 0.5, N = 100, C = $75.26; (4): Ns = 32, r = 0.5, ϕ = 0.3572, p = 0.32,
     N = 100, C = $75.26; (5): Ns = 15, r = 0.5, ϕ = 0.2323, p = 0.15, N = 100,
     C = $75.26; (6): Ns = 15, r = 0.5, ϕ = 0.2323, p = 0.15, N = 100, C = $752.63;
     (7): Ns = 15, r = 0.5, ϕ = 0.2323, p = 0.15, N = 100, C = $1,505.25; (8):
     Ns = 3, r = 0.5, ϕ = 0.2323, p = 0.15, N = 20, C = $75.26; and (9): Ns = 1,
     r = 0.5, ϕ = 0.2323, p = 0.15, N = 7, C = $75.26. Table 3 includes a detailed
     rationale for the use of these parameter values.
2.   As a robustness check, we reconducted the analyses reported in Table 5 by exclud-
     ing non-US samples (i.e. samples #43–44, 166, 194–195, 199–204 and 206 de-
     scribed in Appendix A in the Online Supplement). We also reconducted the

       analyses in Table 5 with non-US samples included, but without using income
       values updated for the non-US samples (from non-US sources). Results from the
       additional analyses were essentially the same as those in Table 5, as detailed in
       Appendix C in the Online Supplement.
 3.    Table 12 also reports financial gains based on samples following normality-based
       shapes (i.e. Weibull or normal), where output differences among stars at the top
       will tend to be even smaller than among exponential-tail samples. Consistent
       with our expectation, in this comparison, we found a stronger diminishing pat-
       tern among the normality-based shapes than among exponential-tail ones.
