Investments in workplace accommodations for disabilities are associated with
increased firm productivity, employee retention, and organizational
performance, though the magnitude and consistency of these effects depend on
the type of accommodation, organizational context, and implementation quality.
1. Introduction
The impact of investments in workplace accommodations for employees with disabilities on firm productivity has
been a subject of growing research and policy interest. A substantial body of evidence indicates that such
accommodations can yield direct benefits for firms, including increased worker productivity, retention of qualified
employees, reduced turnover costs, and improved company morale and culture (Solovieva et al., 2011; Solovieva &
Walls, 2013; Hartnett et al., 2011; Solovieva et al., 2009; Schur et al., 2014; Lindsay et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2021).
Systematic reviews and empirical studies have found that accommodations—ranging from physical modifications
to flexible work arrangements—are often low-cost and can lead to measurable improvements in organizational
performance, profitability, and innovation (Solovieva et al., 2011; Lindsay et al., 2018; Schur et al., 2014; JuradoCaraballo & Quintana García, 2024; Dwertmann et al., 2025; Man et al., 2020). However, the literature also
highlights variability in outcomes depending on the type of accommodation, the nature of the disability, and the
organizational environment (Annett, 2024; Jing et al., 2022; Nevala et al., 2015; Jansen et al., 2021; Van Berkel &
Breit, 2025). Some studies note that while the majority of accommodations are inexpensive, certain cases (e.g.,
those involving personal assistance services) can be more costly, though these costs are frequently offset by
productivity gains and reduced recruitment expenses (Solovieva et al., 2009; Solovieva et al., 2011). There is also
evidence that inclusive practices and supportive leadership further enhance the positive effects of
accommodations on both individual and firm-level outcomes (Zhu et al., 2019; Alfalih & Ragmoun, 2025; Luu, 2019).
Despite these positive findings, gaps remain in rigorous cost-effectiveness evaluations and in understanding the
long-term impacts across different industries and disability types (Padkapayeva et al., 2017; Nevala et al., 2015; Van
Berkel & Breit, 2025). This review synthesizes the current state of research on the relationship between workplace
accommodations for disabilities and firm productivity, drawing on systematic reviews, large-scale surveys, and
recent empirical studies (Solovieva et al., 2011; Annett, 2024; Solovieva & Walls, 2013; Lindsay et al., 2018; JuradoCaraballo & Quintana García, 2024; Nevala et al., 2015; Jansen et al., 2021; Hartnett et al., 2011; Solovieva et al.,
2009; Schur et al., 2014).

3. Results
3.1. Direct Effects of Accommodations on Firm Productivity
Multiple studies report that workplace accommodations lead to increased worker productivity, retention of
qualified employees, and reduced costs associated with turnover and training new hires (Solovieva et al., 2011;
Solovieva & Walls, 2013; Hartnett et al., 2011; Solovieva et al., 2009; Schur et al., 2014; Lindsay et al., 2018).
Employers frequently cite improved company morale and overall productivity as indirect benefits (Solovieva et al.,
2011; Solovieva & Walls, 2013; Hartnett et al., 2011). Quantitative analyses and large-scale surveys confirm that
these benefits are observed across both large and small businesses, with most accommodations incurring minimal
or no cost (Solovieva et al., 2011; Solovieva et al., 2009; Schur et al., 2014).
3.2. Economic and Organizational Performance Outcomes
Systematic reviews and empirical studies demonstrate that hiring and accommodating people with disabilities can
improve profitability, reduce absenteeism, and enhance company reputation (Lindsay et al., 2018; Jurado-Caraballo

‐

& Quintana García, 2024; Jing et al., 2022; Jansen et al., 2021; Dwertmann et al., 2025). Some studies identify a Ushaped relationship between the proportion of disabled employees and firm performance, suggesting that the
impact may vary depending on firm size, industry, and the extent of inclusion (Jing et al., 2022; Jurado-Caraballo &

‐

Quintana García, 2024). Cost-benefit analyses indicate that the financial benefits of accommodations often
outweigh the costs, especially when considering reduced turnover and increased employee loyalty (Solovieva et al.,
2011; Lindsay et al., 2018; Solovieva et al., 2009).

2 / 9

3.3. Moderators and Implementation Factors
The effectiveness of accommodations is influenced by organizational culture, leadership, and the type of disability
being accommodated (Jansen et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2019; Alfalih & Ragmoun, 2025; Luu, 2019). Supportive
leadership and inclusive HR practices amplify the positive effects on productivity and well-being (Zhu et al., 2019;
Alfalih & Ragmoun, 2025; Luu, 2019). However, barriers such as lack of awareness, attitudinal biases, and
bureaucratic challenges can limit the realization of these benefits (Padkapayeva et al., 2017; Nevala et al., 2015;
Syma, 2019; Aichner et al., 2024). The literature also notes that accommodations for invisible or psychological
disabilities are less likely to be granted, despite evidence of their necessity for productivity (Telwatte et al., 2017;
Syma, 2019).
3.4. Cost Considerations and Return on Investment
Most accommodations are low-cost, with many requiring no financial outlay (e.g., flexible scheduling, job
restructuring) (Solovieva et al., 2011; Solovieva et al., 2009; Schur et al., 2014). When costs are incurred, they are
typically offset by direct benefits such as increased productivity and retention (Solovieva et al., 2011; Solovieva et
al., 2009). More expensive accommodations, such as personal assistance services, still yield positive returns
through enhanced productivity and reduced turnover (Solovieva et al., 2009). Studies also highlight that fears of
high costs are often unfounded and that the overall economic argument for disability inclusion is strong (Aichner,
2021; Aichner et al., 2024).

4. Discussion
The research consistently supports the conclusion that investments in workplace accommodations for disabilities
are beneficial for firm productivity and organizational performance (Solovieva et al., 2011; Lindsay et al., 2018;

‐

Jansen et al., 2021; Schur et al., 2014; Jurado-Caraballo & Quintana García, 2024; Solovieva et al., 2009). The
evidence is strongest for direct outcomes such as employee retention, reduced turnover costs, and increased
productivity, with most accommodations being low-cost or cost-neutral (Solovieva et al., 2011; Solovieva et al.,
2009; Schur et al., 2014). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses further corroborate these findings, highlighting
additional benefits such as improved company image, innovation, and workplace morale (Lindsay et al., 2018;

‐

Jurado-Caraballo & Quintana García, 2024; Dwertmann et al., 2025; Man et al., 2020). However, the literature also
points to important caveats: the magnitude of benefits can vary by industry, firm size, and the type of
accommodation or disability (Jing et al., 2022; Nevala et al., 2015; Jansen et al., 2021; Van Berkel & Breit, 2025).
Barriers such as lack of awareness, attitudinal resistance, and insufficient leadership support can limit the
effectiveness of accommodations (Padkapayeva et al., 2017; Nevala et al., 2015; Syma, 2019; Telwatte et al., 2017;
Aichner et al., 2024). There is a need for more rigorous, longitudinal, and industry-specific studies to better quantify
the long-term return on investment and to identify best practices for implementation (Padkapayeva et al., 2017;
Nevala et al., 2015; Van Berkel & Breit, 2025).

5. Conclusion
In summary, the literature demonstrates that investments in workplace accommodations for disabilities generally
have a positive impact on firm productivity, employee retention, and organizational performance, with most
accommodations being low-cost and yielding substantial direct and indirect benefits. The effectiveness of these
investments is enhanced by inclusive organizational cultures and supportive leadership, though variability exists
depending on context and implementation.
5.1. Research Gaps
Despite the strong evidence base, gaps remain in rigorous cost-effectiveness evaluations, longitudinal studies, and
research on specific industries and types of disabilities. There is also a need for more research on the long-term
impacts of accommodations and on best practices for implementation in diverse organizational contexts.
