Implications of Utility Analysis Adjustments for Estimates of Human
Resource Intervention Value
Abstract
This paper argues that most utility analysis (UA) applications are flawed because they employ an overly
simplistic formula. This piece reviews the literature on UA adjustments and demonstrates that the
adjustments have a large impact on resulting estimates. These results imply that human resources programs do
not invariably yield positive returns; rather, intervention success is contingent on program-specific,
organizational, and environmental factors.

        adjustments and demonstrates that the adjustments have a large impact on resulting

        Utility Analysis (UA) allows human resource (HR) decision makers to produce bottom line
figures, thus purportedly (a) aiding managers deciding whether to invest in HR management systems,
such as selection systems or training programs, and (b) adding credibility to the perceived “soft”
decisions commonly associated with HR (Cascio, 2000). The usefulness of UA as a managerial decision
aid, though, is questionable. Many have cautioned that UA produces inflated estimates (Becker, 1989;
Boudreau, 1983a; Cascio, 1993; Latham & Whyte, 1994; Murphy, 1986), which may make managers
skeptical of its results and the methods used to obtain them (Hunter, Schmidt, & Coggin, 1988;
Wintermantel & Mattimore, 1997). Although there are notable instances where UA helps inform
managerial evaluations (e.g., Florin-Thuma & Boudreau, 1987; Morrow, Jarrett, & Rupinski, 1997), some
have argued that other demonstrations with astronomical estimates strain the credibility of UA
specifically, and I/O Psychology in general (Ashe, 1990; Cascio, 1993).
        Even proponents of UA admit that practitioners view UA predictions skeptically (Cronshaw,
1997). However, it is unclear whether adverse reactions to UA signify an aversion to quantitative HR
decision aids in general or simply reflect a disbelief in the results of an inaccurate decision aid. While
recent experiments (Latham &Whyte, 1994; Whyte & Latham, 1997) show that managers do not find UA
to be useful, their analyses omitted potentially useful modifications to the equation which may have
made perceptions of the results more positive. Latham and Whyte (1994; Whyte & Latham, 1997) use
the basic Brogden-Cronbach- Glesser model. Whereas this model represents an important first step in
UA research (i.e., Brogden, 1949; Cronbach & Glesser, 1965), the formula relies on a number of
assumptions. These assumptions are known to limit UA’s accuracy and inflate its estimates; however,


--- PAGE BREAK ---

researchers have produced modifications to the formula to help correct many of these problems (e.g.,
Cascio, 1993).
        To help improve the credibility, and arguably the validity of UA estimates, researchers have
made a number of advances in UA calculation in the form of adjustments to the basic UA formula (e.g.,
Boudreau, 1983a; Boudreau & Berger, 1985; De Corte, 1994; Murphy, 1986); however, no research has
yet examined the implications of all of these adjustments simultaneously. This paper provides a review
of published, algebraic UA adjustments and demonstrates the implications of these adjustments for a
wide range of plausible parameter values. Although there have been descriptive reviews of the types of
adjustments available (e.g., Cascio, 1993), and there have been comparisons of utility models (e.g.,
Judiesch, Schmidt, & Hunter, 1993; Raju, Burke, & Normand, 1990; Raju, Burke, Normand, & Lezotte,
1993), no research has yet compared the magnitude of these adjustments’ impacts.
        Through this review and comparison, this paper contributes to the UA and selection literatures
in two ways. First, this paper investigates the practical implications of applying these adjustments
simultaneously, thus providing guidance for future UA applications as to which UA modifications have
the most prominent effects. This contribution should be of benefit both for practitioners using UA to
estimate values and for researchers investigating how decision-makers react to UA. Second, this paper
demonstrates how the impact of generalziable behavioral findings (e.g., the validity of a type of
selection device) is dependent on a variety of organizational-specific and environmental factors.

The Basic Utility Model, its Assumptions, and its Use

        The basic utility formula, emerging from the work by Brogden (1949) and Cronbach and Glesser
(1965), is as follows:

                                    ∆U = T × Nh × ���
                                                  Zx × r × SDy − C

∆U = Utility change from selection device
Nh = Number of people to be hired
T = Average tenure of those hired
���
Zx = Average Z-score of the predictor of hired employees
r = Correlation between a predictor and criterion
SDy = Dollar value of a standard deviation in the criterion
C = Cos of acquiring and administering a selection battery
        The usefulness of this UA model has been challenged both with respect to the estimation
method and its application by decision makers. The equation subsumes a number of critical


--- PAGE BREAK ---

assumptions, each of which may affect the utility estimate yielded by the formula. Researchers have
proposed algebraic modifications to the UA model to include the use of finance variables (Boudreau,
1983a), account for employee flows over time (Boudreau & Berger, 1985), relax the assumption of top-
down hiring (Hogarth & Einhorn, 1976; Murphy, 1986), recognize that organizations use multiple
selection devices rather than a policy of random selection (Brogden, 1949; Burke & Frederick, 1986; Ruju
& Burke, 1986), and allow for the possibility that organizations will dismiss poor performers (De Corte,
1994). Although other research has also noted a number of other phenomenon that may also effect
utility estimates—labor makets (Becker, 1989), validity changes over time (Henry & Hulin, 1997; Hulin,
Henry, & Noon, 1990), and learning curves (Cascio, 1993)—this paper focuses on evaluating the
implications of the algebraic modifications that have been published in the UA literature. As these
adjustments require greater complexity, it is important to evaluate their relative effects. Although
adding other variables may also have sizable effects, the UA literature has not yet benefited from a
systematic evaluation of the set of techniques proposed to improve the basic UA formula.

                                 Adjustments to the Basic Utility Formula

        Despite concerns regarding its formula and use, the basic utility formula provides an essential
foundation upon which further UA research has been built. Essentially, this utility formula reveals that
the value ascribed to HR programs is attributable to three factors: costs, quantity of employees affected,
and quality of employees affected (Boudreau & Berger, 1985). This section reviews algebraic
modifications to the basic utility formula.
        Note that this paper does not address methods of estimating UA parameters. For example,
accurate UA estimates depend in part on accurate estimates of selection device validity (r). If r is
estimated from range restricted data, then steps should be taken to correct the estimate and produce
an accurate value (see Raju, Burke, & Maurer, 1995). Similarly, there has been substantial debate on
how the dollar value of employee performance should be measured (e.g., Judiesch et al., 1993; Raju et
al., 1990; Raju et al., 1993). This paper views such techniques as methods helping in the estimation of
important parameters, which certainly may have large implications for final UA estimates. Those
employing UA should strive to obtain accurate estimates of the necessary parameters; however, this
paper focuses on the effects of algebraic modifications to the basic UA model.

Adjustments Affecting Estimates of Costs

        Economic factors. As UA supposedly produces estimates that allow managers to evaluate the
value of a HR investment, one of the earliest adjustments to the basic UA formula was to adjust its result


--- PAGE BREAK ---

to reflect variables commonly used when evaluating other investments. Boudreau (1983a) recognized
that UA models addressed economic and financial consequences of HR decisions, but the original UA
formula failed to incorporate certain financial and economic considerations.
        The adjustments introduced by Boudreau (1983a) included three different processes. First, he
differentiated between increases in performance and increases in total value. Performance increases
may cause additional costs, such as increased compensation, higher costs of goods sold, etc. Thus,
Boudreau (1983a) introduced variable costs into the utility formula to reflect the added costs associated
with performance gains. Second, Boudreau noted that taxes play a role for affecting the gains and losses
associated with any investment. He thus incorporated tax rate considerations into the basic utility
formula. Third, Boudreau modified the UA formula to determine the present value of an investment. By
incorporating a discount factor into the equation, the UA formula computes the present value of a
program and can be more comparable to other investment information. Accounting for such economic
factors often dramatically reduces the estimates produced by the UA formula (Boudreau, 1983a; 1991).

Adjustments Affecting Estimates of Quantity

        Employee flows. Employee flows into, through, and out of an organization over time influence
the value of a HR intervention (Boudreau & Berger, 1985). These effects may occur over multiple years;
thus, considering the utility of an intervention only in its first year may understate its utility (Boudreau,
1983b). This occurs when a program affects a workforce for more than one year or if an organization
implements a program for multiple time periods. Thus, a program affects new portions of a workforce,
and the benefit for multiple groups may continue over multiple time periods.
        Employee flows affect the quantity of employees influenced by a HR intervention (Boudreau,
1983b). A simple adjustment involves multiplying the benefit by the average tenure of selected
employees (Schmidt, Hunter, McKenzie, & Muldrow, 1979), which was included above as part of the
basic utility model; however, this approach misses aspects of what occurs over time, such as additional
costs and benefits associated with replacing those who leave the organization. It also ignores the time
value of money, for which the economic adjustments account.
        Specific derivation and application of these methods are described in detail in Boudreau
(1983b), but essentially require that each cohort of employees be tracked over time. Whereas tracking
employee cohorts in multiple time periods adds complexity, it makes the UA estimate more precise
(Boudreau & Berger, 1985).


--- PAGE BREAK ---

Adjustments Affecting Estimates of Quality

        Employee flows. In addition to effects on quantity, employee flows may affect the average
quality of employees in an organization. Boudreau and Berger (1985) illustrate how the quality of those
staying with an organization (versus that of those leaving) affects the utility of a selection system. As for
the adjustment for quantity described above, accounting for employee quality over time necessitates
tracking cohorts over the requisite time periods. This allows the UA formula to account for such
phenomena as the relationship between turnover and performance, which affects average employee
performance levels over time. Granted, such calculations necessitate more work and greater complexity,
but they describe more specifically employee performance levels that result from a HR intervention.
        The Boudreau and Berger (1985) model contributes to the process of UA calculations by
providing a framework for considering costs, quantity, and quality over time. It has no specific algebraic
changes regarding quality, but provides a method that allows the UA calculator to consider such
relationships as that between turnover and performance (e.g., Williams & Livingstone, 1994). Others
have built upon this framework to consider other changes to UA calculations, such as the effect of a
probationary period for employees (De Corte, 1994).
        Effect of a probationary period. Another refinement to the utility model involves determining
the effect of providing a probationary period for new hires. In a probationary period, an organization
dismisses those who do not perform adequately after a given time period (e.g., one year). To reflect this
change, the utility equation must estimate the performance difference between initially hired
employees and employees who survive the probationary period (De Corte, 1994).
        Because organizations dismiss lower performers, the average performance of a given cohort
increases after the probationary period ends. As described by De Corte (1994), the change in average
performance depends on the validity of the selection device and the cutoff for determining what
constitutes unsuccessful performance. De Corte (1994) also discusses the importance of accounting for
such costs as training cost per selectee and separation cost per unsuccessful employee, both of which
would impact the cost estimate of a hiring program.
        The effect of De Corte’s adjustments are to increase the estimated utility of a selection device;
however, this increase occurs for the intervention in question and the current policy (or random
selection). Including a probationary period thus reduces the utility gain attributable to a selection
intervention. De Corte (1994) explains the specific utility model changes involved in detail, although they
can be seen as a special case of the Boudreau and Berger (1985) model. It is, therefore, relatively easy to
incorporate this adjustment using the Boudreau and Berger (1985) framework.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

        Multiple selection devices. Another assumption of the basic utility model is that it provides the
utility gain of a selection battery over a policy of random selection (Boudreau, 1991; Cascio, 2000).
Utility researchers (e.g., Brogden, 1949; Burke & Frederick, 1986; Ruju & Burke, 1986) have long noted
this assumption to be weak. An examination of organizational practices shows a majority of
organizations use multiple selection devices, such as reference checks, interviews, application blanks,
work samples, cognitive ability tests, and assessment centers (Gatewood & Feild, 1994). Although some
of these devices have low validity, the validity of all of these methods is greater than zero (Gatewood &
Feild, 1994). Thus, comparing a new selection device to a policy of random hiring overestimates the
value of the selection device.
        Incorporating the effects of multiple selection devices into UA calculations is not new. Brogden
(1949) pointed out that the formula for estimating the payoff of a selection device may be modified to
describe the difference between two selection batteries. This same approach continues to be
recommended as a means to compare the utility of an existing selection program with another selection
program (Raju & Burke, 1986), and has been applied to make such demonstrations (Boudreau, 1991;
Burke & Frederick, 1986). To properly utilize the UA formula, the validity of the selection battery
including the new selection device must be computed and compared to the validity of the selection
battery without the new method (or the battery it is replacing). The value of r that must then be used in
the analysis equals the difference between the predictive validity of the new selection battery (RNew) and
the predictive validity of the old selection battery (ROld).
        Note, however, that simply subtracting the correlation values (e.g., Boudreau, 1991; Raju &
Burke, 1986) is only a partial adjustment to the basic utility equation. Instead, this adjustment should be
incorporated with the other adjustments for cost, quantity, and quality because the validity adjustment
may have effects for other UA parameters. For example, a different validity score may also affect the UA
modifications attributable to employee flows and a probationary period. Computing utility using RNew
and ROld, and then computing the difference in utility values is therefore recommended.
        Departures from top-down hiring. UA estimates from the basic model are calculated with the
assumption that candidates are hired in a top-down manner. That is, those with the highest predicted
performance scores are hired until all the desired number of positions have been filled. This assumption
is unwarranted because some high-scoring applicants may reject offers (Hogarth & Einhorn, 1976;
Murphy, 1986). Additionally, some high scoring job applicants may not receive offers because of specific
organizational selection practices, such as veteran preference policies or efforts to enhance racial
and/or gender composition. When the top job candidates are not hired, the employer must make offers


--- PAGE BREAK ---

to employees that the selection devices predicted to be less qualified. This results in a decrease in the
average predicted score of the new employees, or in other words, a decrease in ���
                                                                               𝑍𝑦 .
        Murphy (1986) provides formulae to determine the effect of job offer rejections on resulting
utility estimates. He provides three cases: where applicants reject job offers at random, where the top
applicants reject job offers, and where the probability of job acceptance is negatively correlated with
quality. Murphy (1986) and others (Hogarth & Einhorn, 1976) argue that the most reasonable
assumption is a negative correlation between ability and probability to accept offers. The calculation
thus requires information (or an assumption) about (a) the relationship between the quality of the
applicants and the probability of accepting a job, and (b) the proportion of job offers being rejected.
Note that if multiple adjustments are being applied, and particularly if considering an old selection
battery rather than random hiring, the utility estimate requires incorporating the Murphy (1986)
adjustment for both the new selection battery and the old selection battery.

                                             The Present Study

        Current UA research suggests that (a) the basic UA formula has flaws, and (b) improvements
exist to modify the formula. This paper focuses on the effects that five algebraic UA adjustments—
economic variables, employee flows, probationary periods, existing selection batteries, and rejected job
offers— have on utility estimates. To date, no study has systematically examined the effects of multiple
UA adjustments applied simultaneously.
        By themselves, each of the UA adjustments relaxes an assumption of the basic UA model. Each
UA adjustment should yield a lower result than produced by the basic UA model. This should occur
either by directly reducing the utility estimate or by increasing the utility estimate for both the
intervention in question (e.g., a new selection battery) and the previous condition (e.g., the current
selection battery or a policy of random selection). However, the magnitude of such changes will also
depend on the many factors entering into the utility equation. Even in cases where there is high validity,
combinations of organizational practices and environmental circumstances may make such
interventions a poor investment. Thus, although there may be generalizable findings of device validity,
or an intervention may be heralded as a “best practice” (e.g., Huselid, 1995; Pfeffer, 1994; Terpstra &
Rozell, 1993), the modified utility equations suggest that the value of such practices will depend on a
variety of situational parameters.

                                                  Method

         Computer simulation was used to examine the effects of various combinations of adjustments in
circumstances where the parameters required by the utility model varied. The simulation generates
parameters required by the basic UA model and the five algebraic adjustments described above. The
simulator yielded data for two sets of analyses. The first set, a usefulness analysis, examines the relative
magnitude of each of the adjustments. The second set provides a better illustration of the implications
by applying the adjustments to the UA example used by Latham and Whyte (1994; Whyte & Latham,
1997).
         Parameter values were chosen to represent a wide range of realistic levels, shown in Table 1.
The values are based on the type of values used in the initial description of UA adjustments (e.g.,
Boudreau, 1983a; Murphy, 1986; De Corte, 1994), the range of values from previous UA applications
(e.g., see Boudreau, 1991), results of meta-analyses (e.g., Williams & Livingstone, 1994), and levels
reported in HR texts (e.g., Gatewood & Feild, 1994). Note that the intent of this paper is not to provide a
literature review of UA parameters, but to reveal the implications of the UA adjustments for a range of
realistic scenarios. The values employed by the simulator cover a wide range of values, and thus yield
diverse realistic environments for the simulation. For example, in the Boudreau (1991) review of UA
studies, the number of people hired in these studies ranged from 1 to 225,731; however, 95% of the
studies had values between 1 and 1100. Thus, this range of values was used to represent what would
likely be observed in other UA applications.
         The simulation can compute a utility estimate based on any combination of desired
adjustments, specific parameter values, or randomly selected values from the ranges reported in Table
1. First, the simulator generates the values for each parameter. Each value is generated independently.
Thus, the expected correlation between any two variables is zero; however, a large number of
simulations are used to provide a comprehensive array of value combinations. Each of the values is
randomly generated from a uniform distribution, except for the number of people selected and the cost
per applicant. Examination of the Boudreau (1991) review of UA studies showed that these variables
were skewed (i.e., there were mostly lower values, but a significant tail of the distribution extending to
large values, resembling distributions of personal income). Thus, to reflect these distributions, uniform
variables were first generated, and then the exponential of those values were used. Uniform
distributions were employed to ensure representation of all values throughout the distribution. Because
the distributions were chosen to represent a range of likely values, there was no reason to force the


--- PAGE BREAK ---

simulation to choose values predominantly from the center of the distribution as would have occurred
had a normal distribution been used.




        Once the parameters have been generated, the simulator computes the utility estimate for the
basic utility model and for any specified combination of adjustments. If the results from multiple
adjustments are desired (e.g., the researcher wanted to see the result of applying (a) the economic
adjustments, (b) the adjustment for employee flows, and (c) the result of applying both economic and
employee flow adjustments), the program computes the multiple utility estimates for each set of
parameters. The user of the simulator also specifies how many sets of parameters to generate.

Usefulness Analysis

        To investigate the relative contribution of the various adjustments on resulting utility estimates,
and to inform the literature of the practical implications of these adjustments, we performed a form of
usefulness analysis (Darlington, 1968). A usefulness analysis generally examines a predictor’s
contribution to explaining unique variance in a criterion beyond another predictor’s (or set of
predictors’) contribution. Although generally applied to multiple regression analysis, it provides a useful
framework for examining the relative strengths of the various adjustments. The method reveals which
adjustments have the largest impact, both initially and after other adjustments have been applied. The


--- PAGE BREAK ---

results of the procedure provide a logic to apply when selecting adjustments if not all adjustments can
or need to be used: in order of the relative practical significance of each UA adjustment.
        The procedure entailed using each adjustment in the UA calculation and noting the strength of
the effect. Because the distributions of the effects were heavily skewed, it made more sense to examine
the median effect as a measure of adjustment strength rather than mean effect, which could be biased
by a few extreme values. After applying all five of the adjustments independently, the adjustment with
the largest median effect would then be applied in addition to each of the remaining four individual
adjustments. Of these four combinations of two adjustments, the added adjustment with the largest
median effect is again selected, and the process repeats with combinations of three adjustments. The
process continues until the relative strength of each adjustment, after applying the various larger-effect
adjustments, has been estimated.
        The simulator generated 10,000 UA scenarios. For each scenario, the simulator generated values
for each of the variables listed in Table 1. Each variable was generated independently of the other
variables, and each scenario’s variables were generated independently of the previous scenarios. Using
the data for each scenario, utility estimates were computed using the five adjustments applied
independently. Table 2 presents the median and mean effects.
        In column one of Table 2, all adjustments are compared to the estimate of the basic UA formula.
Accounting for economic variables had the largest median (and mean) effect. Thus, this analysis
suggests that, for a variety of organizational circumstances, the Boudreau (1983a) alternations have the
greatest practical significance on resulting utility estimates. The simulator then generated utility
estimates (still using the same 10,000 cases) using the economic variable adjustment in addition to each
of the four other adjustments. The second column of Table 2 depicts the effect of implementing the
remaining four adjustments both in comparison to the basic utility model and beyond that accounted
for by the economic variable adjustments. The adjustment for considering the implications of multiple
selection devices had the largest median effect and thus was selected as the next most “useful”
adjustment. The procedure was repeated, and the importance of the other variables were ranked, with
the (a) economic adjustments and (b) inclusion of multiple devices followed by (c) departures from top-
down hiring, (d) a probationary period, and (e) employee flows.
        After applying all five adjustments, the median effect size of the total set of adjustments was
291%, and the mean effect was 298%. This suggests that, although the majority of resulting utility
estimates for the simulated HR interventions are still positive, the modifications to the basic UA model
have sizable and noteworthy practical effects on the resulting estimates.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

        Note that the minimum total effect of applying all of the adjustments simultaneously (i.e., the
largest utility estimate provided after all five modifications were applied) was to decrease the estimate
by 71%. Furthermore, the modified estimates were negative 16% of the time. This supports the view
that the utility adjustments substantially decrease the utility estimate. Of greater importance, these
results suggest that while valid selection devices may often lead to increased organizational utility, this


--- PAGE BREAK ---

result is not necessarily generalizable. Rather, the estimated value of a selection battery is contingent on
organizational and environmental characteristics.

Illustrating the Implications: The Latham and Whyte Example

        The usefulness analysis (a) demonstrates that these adjustments, on average, have large effects
on resulting utility estimates, and (b) presents information that may inform UA users on which
adjustments have the largest effects. However, it would be desirable to provide the UA with more
intervention-specific and organizational- specific data to yield a distribution of utility estimates specific
to a given intervention. Although the usefulness analysis shows the expected value of changes to utility
estimates to be large, it is tenuous to generalize these expected value changes to specific UA examples.
Indeed, although these results inform us that HR interventions do not universally have high utility,
neither do they say that all interventions have poor utility. Rather, it depends on a variety of situational
parameters. Thus, to help illustrate the effects of the UA adjustments on an actual UA example, this
paper examines the UA case employed by Latham and Whyte (1994; Whyte & Latham, 1997) in their
experiments.
        Although, as discussed earlier, it is often widely accepted that estimates from the basic UA
formula are unrealistic (e.g., Cascio, 1993), Latham and Whyte (1994; Whyte & Latham, 1997)
investigated how managers react to the results of a basic UA formula. In two separate experiments, the
authors presented a group of managers with results of a UA that revealed a large financial return for
implementing a valid selection procedure. Despite the UA suggesting a $601 million return for a HR
program, those provided the UA were actually less likely to want to implement the selection procedure
than those in other experimental groups that had less information. These results occurred when UA was
explained to the managers (Latham & Whyte, 1994) and even when an expert provided additional
information through a presentation (Whyte & Latham, 1997).
        The UA example used by Latham and Whyte reports a 14,000% return on investment. This paper
argues that this return is unrealistically high, and that it may have been the lack of credibility of these
results that led to managers’ avoidance of this recommendation. Latham and Whyte (1994; Whyte &
Latham, 1997) used the simple UA model to calculate the utility in their studies. Both studies used the
same example, which is taken largely from another published UA (Cronshaw, 1986); however, they
updated the dollars to reflect 1992 prices and changed the validity from the original 0.52 to 0.40 to
present “a more conservative” (Latham & Whyte, 1994: 38), and perhaps more believable, validity
coefficient. In the example, an organization hires 470 of 1410 applicants, each new hire stays with the

company an average of 18 years, SDy equals $16,280, and the total cost of the selection procedure is
$429,110. The utility calculation is thus as follows: i

                              ∆U = 18 × 470 × 1.09 × .4 × 16290 − 429110

                                              ∆U = $59,657,532

While there is no specific evidence to support or contradict this estimate, the result lacks face validity. In
the present study, the UA adjustments are applied to this example to help illustrate their implications
and to show how they yield a distribution of estimates that may be more believable.
        Because the UA adjustments require additional information than was provided by Latham and
Whyte (1994; Whyte & Latham, 1997) or Cronshaw (1986), the simulator generated a range of cases
with the needed additional variables. For each scenario, the simulator generated values for the missing
parameters. Again, for each of the missing parameters, values were determined randomly based on the
distribution of values reported in Table 1. Additionally, the validity of the old selection battery was also
varied, coming from a random uniform distribution from 0.05 to 0.38. Again, each variable was
generated independently of the other variables. Values for the variables not generated by the simulator
(i.e., years, number of people selected, applicant per hire, SDy, cost per applicant, and device validity)
were taken from the Latham and Whyte (1994) example. To illustrate the implications of these
adjustments for a wide range of environmental and organizational conditions, the simulator generated
10,000 scenarios.
        For each scenario, the UA adjustments are applied in the order determined by the previous
usefulness analysis. Table 3 shows the distribution of utility estimates that result when applying one to
all five of the UA modifications to the Latham and Whyte example. As expected, the first step had a
noteworthy impact: the adjustment for economic variables reduced the mean estimate by $42,800,529.
Examining the range of utility estimates for the 10,000 scenarios generated by the simulator, the
Boudreau (1983a) adjustments reduced the utility estimate by over half of the initial estimate (i.e.,
$30,000,0001) for over 98.5% of the estimates involved.
        The remaining adjustments had smaller, but still noticeable, effects on the final utility estimate.
The mean estimated utility dropped $9.3 million when the existence of multiple selection devices was
considered, and another $4.4 million when deviations from top-down hiring were also considered. The
adjustments for including a probationary period decreased the mean expected utility by a further $0.5
million, and accounting for employee flows dropped the mean utility estimate by another $0.5 million.
Overall, using all five UA adjustments reduced the original estimate of $59,657,532 to the mean utility

estimates of $2,228,170: more than a 96% reduction. The median return was $1,738,861; the smallest
outcome was an estimated loss of $2,577,238; and the largest predicted gain was $17,162,452; or over
71% less than the initial estimate.

                                                 Conclusions

        The above results demonstrate the magnitude that adjustments to the UA formula have on
utility estimates. These results show that one of the major criticisms of UA, that it yields unrealistically
large estimates, may in part be a reflection of using an overly simplistic formula. Although the UA
adjustments require greater complexity, such adjustments sizably change UA estimates, even upwards
of millions of dollars.
        The results from this study lead to two contributions for UA and HR research. First, the results
reveal the relative effect that each of the published algebraic modifications to the UA formula have, and
thus present some guidance for researchers and practitioners deciding upon whether certain
adjustments should be included. Although the magnitude of the changes are a function of organizational
and environmental factors, these results suggest that economic modifications have the largest average
impact, relatively closely followed by the effect of considering multiple devices, followed by weaker
effects for deviations from top-down hiring, a probationary period for new employees, and considering
employment flows.
        Note that while this usefulness analysis provides insights into general steps UA researchers or
users should follow (i.e., including the first two modifications would likely have a large practical impact,
and the other modifications may also have large impacts depending on the circumstance), these results
do not suggest a single set of modifications that should be blindly implemented. Rather, users of UA
should consider their specific needs and adapt UA to meet those needs. These needs may be a function
of the how complex the UA can be, the nature of the HR intervention, the business environment, and/or
the audience for the UA results. Thus, UA should not follow one method blindly. These results show that
all UA modifications have noteworthy effects, with some effects noticeably larger than others; it is up to
the user of the UA, though, to use the modifications that are appropriate.
        Morrow and colleagues (Morrow et al., 1997) provide a superb example of this. When using a
UA to help evaluate the effectiveness of training programs, they admittedly used an approximation that
included error. Their point was that “[human resource] decisions need to be based upon good
information; perfectly accurate information is not critical” (Morrow et al., 1997: 113), nor is it even
possible as “any field application of UA will rely upon an effect size calculated with an imperfect quasi-


--- PAGE BREAK ---

experimental design” (Morrow et al., 1997: 114). They thus conclude that managerial acceptance of a
UA model is particularly important. The results of the present study can inform future work like Morrow
et al.’s by informing researchers and practitioners of the potential effect of UA model adjustments, and
thus helping them agree upon a utility model to implement. The present study’s results suggest that if
the decision context does involve variables relevant to these adjustments, then such adjustments may
make sizable changes to the UA estimate. This study’s results do not suggest that all adjustments need
to be invariably applied; however, they do reveal that such adjustment should not be dismissed due to a
flawed assumption that such adjustments would have minor effects on subsequent results.

        The second contribution of this paper is to reveal that the estimated impact of human resource
interventions is dependent on a number of organizational-specific and environmental variables. The
magnitude of these changes to the UA estimates suggests that the trend of past published UA
demonstrations to invariably suggest large returns for HR investments is inappropriate. This supports
the view that the value of HR interventions for organizational performance are contingent on
organizational and environmental characteristics, as opposed to the notion that there is a set of “best
practices” which invariably contribute to organizational performance. Thus, evidence of validity or effect
sizes from meta-analyses, or list of “best practices” from certain organizations, should not be
interpreted as evidence of utility. Rather, this paper suggests that the value of HR interventions may at
least in part be situationally specific.
        Modifications of the UA model, like those described and applied in the present study, are
important for potentially improving the accuracy of the measurement technique; however, the ultimate
goal of UA applications is to influence decision making. To date, UA has not had its intended effect on
decision making (Boudreau, 1996; Cascio, 1996). If UA is to become a useful decision aid, research is
needed in a number of areas to help overcome this general trend. First, laboratory studies like Latham
and Whyte’s can contribute to this goal; however, such research needs to move beyond simply looking
at end-results of artificial decision environments and help understand the cognitive processes involved
when people react to decision aids, particularly in human resources. Although such research would lose
the contextual and organizational factors which would affect real-world decision making, the controlled
laboratory environment could help yield a better understanding of how individuals process UA
information, and therefore how the technique or training can be adjusted to improve human resource
decision making.
        Second, research needs to examine UA implementations for actual decisions (Boudreau, 1996).
Although less controlled than a laboratory study, such research can provide needed information on how
actual decision-makers use UA to justify or make decisions. Such research should pay attention to the
effects that decision contexts and organizational characteristics have when judging managerial reactions
to UA results.
        To this effect, research is also needed to help specify the types of environments in which HR
interventions are being implemented. This study’s analyses used simulation to represent a range of
realistic situations, but when applied to actual decision making, better approximations of the additional
required variables would lead to greater accuracy. Hence, descriptive research is needed to provide a
clearer picture of the level of these crucial variables in organizations. Questions such as “how many


--- PAGE BREAK ---

applicants apply for jobs?” and “what is the relationship between predicted performance and the
probability of accepting a job?” are important issues not only for UA research, but for staffing research
in general. Furthermore, this study assumed zero correlation between the simulation parameters.
Research is also needed on the relationships between contextual variables for human resource decision
making. ii If such intercorrelations significantly deviate from 0, then utility estimates may be notably
different. Future research should therefore look into the nature of these relationships and the
implications of such relationships on UA estimates.
        There are still a number of limitations thwarting the widespread usefulness of UA. While this
study shows how the UA adjustments can provide substantially different estimates, we are still a long
way from UA being a useful tool for managers. Notably, there are two fundamental problems: (a) the
complexity involved in UA computation, and (b) the lack of training of HR managers. These problems are
a reflection of technology and training, and not inherently a flaw of UA. UA, even in its basic form, is
often viewed as complex. Some have criticized the inclusion of just the economic variables (Boudreau
1983a) as “so long and complex as to be daunting . . . and as such is very difficult for personnel
psychologists and HR managers to understand” (Hunter et al., 1988: 527). Incorporating the adjustments
of UA discussed in this paper essentially eliminates the possibility of performing UA by hand. Some
adjustments, such as those discussed by De Corte (1994) for estimating the effect of a probationary
period, require computations beyond the capability of most spreadsheet programs. It should be noted,
though, that just as it was not surprising that techniques, such as structural equations modelling, were
not popular before computer programs were available to solve the necessary equations, researchers
should not be surprised that sophisticated utility models are not employed when paper and pencils are
often the only tools available for UA computation. Technology must be developed that facilitates UA,
including the adjustments discussed in the research.
        But perhaps more important than technology, managers need to understand UA and be trained
in the use of the technology. In the Latham and Whyte (1994) study, “none of the managers . . . had
taken courses on utility analysis, HR accounting, or validation procedures” (p. 36), and in the Whyte and
Latham (1997) study, “none of [the managers] had been exposed to utility analysis prior to the study”
(p. 603). Although it is likely that most managers are not educated in UA procedures, this is a fault of HR
education (or perhaps staffing and training in HR positions) rather than a fault of UA. It is incumbent on
researchers of UA to explore how utility estimates affect decision making so as to inform UA research of
ways to make the device more of a decision making aid (Boudreau, 1996).


--- PAGE BREAK ---

        For a complex decision making tool to be useful, the users of the decision aid must desire the
information it provides and be trained in its use. We should not be surprised that an individual untrained
with a use of a decision aid fails to adhere to the results of the aid. For example, we would not be
surprised to find that managers with no experience in economics, accounting, and finance would not
trust the recommendations of the Merton and Scholes options pricing formula (e.g., Black & Scholes,
1973). This formula is as complex, if not more complex, than UA but is extensively used and has had an
impact that merited it winning the Nobel prize in economics (e.g., Economist, 1997).
        As HR must increasingly justify its use of resources and demonstrate its value to other functions
in the organization, HR managers must become able to communicate the merit of HR interventions. As
educators and researchers of HR, we must advance the level of knowledge in the field and keep
managers (and future managers) abreast of these advances to provide them with the tools they need for
the future.

   In the original Cronshaw (1986) example, and in Latham and Whyte’s examples, Zx was set equal to 1.10. For a
selection ratio of 1/3, however, the value is actually closer to 1.09. We used the value 1.09 to reflect the more
accurate value, and thus our results deviate slightly from those of Latham and Whyte.
